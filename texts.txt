I mean we can do it if we win money 
Aw okay:( let me know! Also can try to get pics or whatever for you
Hey Erik! Were you able to get out of your advising hours
Nice, that's a must see. There should be a lot of heckling.
I saw that. Pens have the 3rd string  goalie.
Having no fans or revenue has forced them to be smart. They were the leading edge in shifts.
So you do keep the threads in an array? Is that how you're accessing them?
Super delagates so the dems can control who the candidate is. The republicans wish they had that to control Trump.
He's been beating her in every state and out fund raising her but he is getting skunked on the super delegates.
Plus even though it's a good strategy , you don't want the permanent stain of voting for Bernie.
Are you registered up there? I think you are registered in Nassau county. To vote I think you have to do an absentee ballot.
I believe next 
On campus? It must have been big.
Ted Cruz is going to have a rally in bing on Friday.

This may be like 3 months in advance lol but do u think you'd be coming home for 4th of July?
Yea I told you that
Yeah there should be an API endpoint. 
Oh oh ok. So like ml cdt? I like it
Okay cool
Yeah, i guess thats true.Â Â Iâll definitely do it if u donât want to
I would want to but i donât think iâd ever be able to make meetings on mondays, so unless the meetings were at another time i donât think that would work
Training consistently is a bit easier. You only need like 3 to 4 hours per week to get it in
Diet is super tricky to dial in unless you prepare meals ahead of time and only have to heat them up to eat quickly during you busy day
Haha cool man. It's very tough on both counts, but you're off to a good start by just showing up and trying...
i mean possibly via the api, you canât get it through the UI?
ooo
Emailed you
How was your soup?
Nigga
They had a 2-0 lead so they had to put in the 4th string goalie. Rags fans are pissed that we tanked and they didn't tank against the Wings.
Ah okay, could have sworn you told me it was like a 2.6. Nvm

Hey! I just committed to RPI. Thanks so much for your help though!
Yes , they can't get more than one point. It's a makeup snow game. The flyers clinched today too so they won't be trying. Either.
Rags
Ok

This is your turf. That sounds hard though 
Ooo

Precisely 
Exactly

theyâre way way more sophisticated 
yik yak shat on me, tinder Definitely will
totally unsupervised 
and we could reverse engineer tinder but people do that all the time and get shat on, also weâd have no ground truth
ok that dataset could work
completely good idea though
but i think its been done a bunch, also where would we get data
that would be

Isles beat the caps in ot and cliched a playoff spot. Hopefully they stay were they are, don't pass the rags and stay ahead of Phiily. They would end up playing Fla on the first round and I think stay in that division. Stamkos has a blot clot and is out if the make it to the second round.

Yea no worries I thought you were only coming Saturday.
Aren't you coming?
Surprise party for Rob
Motorcycle biker theme on Saturday get pumped
Are you on campus
You have a fb pic in a cheerleading outfit, so we already know you look good in an uniform
No no, I think you should be an actual cheerleader
What sport?
I'll snag you one doe
For student athletes lol
They put them out at the Events center on Tuesdays
I.e me
It's not douchebaggery if you're jacked as fuck
I'm going to crush algo discussions tanked up
So yea
I just got like 7 tank tops
Sadly no :( I can get more next Tuesday
Would bang/10
It was green, firm, fit in my hand perfectly. Crisp when I bit into it, tart and sweet at the same time
But I get your point
It's all important
I'm about to go home and crush gains too
We can be friends again
Thatta boy
I'm also eating the best apple I think I've ever had
What time is you're first class?
I don't think they make them that black
Of course - I'll give you the green one, it'll bring out your eyes
You should do a ponytail, though
Mhmm I'm thinking I'll go straight, then be sporty later in the week
And I snap chatted you, I had to abort it keeps falling down :/
Lol my bad, it's hard to interpret over text
Oh
~sarcasm~
Eh, it's kind of a turn off
I think those my make head look weird, but aight lol
What should I do with my hair? Straight, pony, braid, bun...
Hmm I can't do that, once I'm up I'm up
That was my exact plan, then I had to poop :/
ðð¼
lol nice
sounds about right
That's perfect 
Sure! I'm actually going on a business trip today, returning Friday, so how about this weekend, sometime on Saturday?
Either way thanks a lot
Yea that's what I said
Idk I'm leaning more toward RPI and I don't even know why I just got a sense of belonging over there. I liked Bing a lot but I just think that's where I'm meant to be for some reason
Yeah he did
My mom is more for Binghamton 
Yeah I know that. I don't know why I like it I just really do lol I appreciate your help I'll let you know if I decide 
Yeah I got like $52,000 in merit so money isn't an issue
Ok because I actually really like RPI and I'm thinking of committing but I want to make sure I'm not screwing myself over academically 
Hi it's Gina, I have all my college decisions back and now I have to decide. I was just wondering do you think Bing and RPI are academically on the same level for CS 
Nooo I haven't heard of him sorryyy
Yea sure that's gucci
hrow a surprise party on Saturday for him. Any theme ideas????
Sup chief, I hope the cruise was phenomenal. I've got a question for you: my housemate rob is turning twenty three on Saturday and we are trying not to t
Very mature of you to meet with her and clear it up 
I meant you 
Lol we 
Im glad we got it all cleared up 
Omg yayayayya
Really!? 
Hey what time do you think you're gonna swing by 
Such busy people
So many plans 
We're so popular 
Also the dinner I promised you probably can't happen this week until after Thursday Bc I have a lot to do hehe
I will find someone who hasn't gone yet I'm determined 
I have crackers and expired yogurt in my kitchen lol
So sad
Did you go to wegmans yet??
I stopped in Syracuse for the night to see Beau
But if we do have an open discussion I think everyone including me will voice for you 
You guys are obviously really close, so maybe just talk to her before the meeting and just explain how you were not trying to harm anyone and you understand it was not appropriate in a work setting. It's just that were all friends so the line was a little unclear but now it's super defined and you understand. 
Yeah it's weird I feel like we're all in the same boat where no one things you were being offensive 
Just be careful with my backpack please Bc my computer is in it!!!
Thank ya mucho
Tomorrow is fine!! 
Julia said she left my stuff with you?
I'm home!!!
Oh wait there is no peer meeting!! 
Don't be tho, what you did was not bad in the big picture. You know you can be hard on yourself for it. It was really just a joke taken the wrong way 
I'm nervous too! 
I know, bb, I know
I appreciate it <3
Yeah, saw that
And nah son, I'll be back in tomorrow morning

I approve, those are indeed "gâð¼ï¸ooâð¼d memes"
So not a requirement
"Preferably"
Try one you haven't tried before, you might surprise yourself

Lol, understandable
Who's your favorite?

I'm my own favorite porn star
I saw pusheen pajamas at H&M the other day
He licked me earlier today, though, so I felt a little loved
He's a butt

Mhmm, bleh. I'm sure you're right, though, this will work itself out soon enough
I'm guessing Lokesh brought it to her attention? This has been going on for awhile, strange it's coming up now
Also good point, it's in the public eye anyway
Yeah, it makes her more relatable and cooler imo
(both I guess)
story of my life, i know
, I don't understand her reaction to that either
And on the groupme posting, I feel like when you're in a position of authority like she is you have to have some humor...no ones trying to disrespect her
e thinks you're trying to cause trouble
Oh true, when Jake transferred you to Cat you mentioned she didn't think it was an issue at all. Youre also one of her favorite peers, I don't get why sh
Maybe talking to her in person would straighten things out?
roupme was part of a joke, since Jake had said he'd 'get you back'...I guess not :/
Oh wow, I'm sorry Erik :/ 
That doesn't really sound like Sharon at all, shes  always so easy going...I actually half-wondered if Lokesh posting in the g

Well so did Erik last week soo...
Also, have you ever even posted something from Sharon's fb?
Glad you had such a fun time tho
Lol ya that's how people feel after that stuff lol. Also why overweight people love cruises lol 
How was the cruise? 
Of course 
I gotchu you with the support 
Yeah for real 
But I guess from like Sharon as a director, maybe she cares more idk..
And I thought it was a funny joke when it first happened. And I told my boyfriend about it and he thought it was ridiculous that Lokesh told Sharon 
Like I didn't think anyone would care 
I personally thought lokesh was joking when he sent those messages 
Oh man yeah don't respond today 
Sooo awkward 
Did you send her something first? 
What you send back? 
Oh I see
What she send to you??
Lemme see what you sent!? 
Omg 
Ok thanks.

NVM about the whole Mary Jo thing â it was a double-entry on her part. You should be receiving just one check.
Just make sure itâs for $1652 or whatever and you should be good.
I was looking for a meme to send you, but theyâre all self-deprecating instead of supportiveâ¦
Cool cool cool
Glad it went well :)
Cool, sounds good
How was OS? (Or did you not have it yet?)
A cruise?? Damn girl
lol
Okay, well, it seems that youâre supposed to receive a check for $1652.something, and another for $331.46 (IIRC). The check for $1652 is actually supposed to cover the $331.46 as well, from what youâd sent me (Mary Joâs mistake, I think). If you get both checks, you can cash the $1652 check no problem. Please donât cash the other one though; still trying to figure out with Mary Jo what to do about that one, because we need that money in our account.
Hey bud, quick question â did you get reimbursed from the Foundation twice for HackBU things?
whatcha doing for spring break
damn
That blows 
Dood 
Will you console my tears 
Fml 447 is at 8am in the fall 
Done

I'm sure you'll do well, though. I have faith in you, you cute pupper you
Hey, how's it going? I'm on my way home now; still need help?

If you'd like a tickle in your day, know that nofap's leadership is freaked out over a hyper militant sect called "Heirs of the Sun"
I was able to work out some of the kinks it's getting kinda cool

Would bang
How are you studying for OS btw? Book, slides, or just everything?
Lol

So, me, in a room, by myself, looking up dank memesâ¦ Donât I already have a PhD in that?
looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
in other news though this shit is tight
i hope your phone learn to never send to me again thx
top kek, though, it uses jQuery
Obfuscated to shit, but looks like itâs just a simple Javascript file that makes a web request.
So, the zip file just contains a single Javascript file. Looking at it now
lololololololololol
They didnât actually send it from my address, just spoofed it to look like that. Super easy to do. In an email header, you get to declare what email address is sending the email, so you can literally set that to anything.
lel, itâs not a big deal, just want to see what the spammers sent me
âkill me plzâ - citizens using encryption
âlol good oneâ
In other news, I woke up this morning to an email from itai@itaiferber.net to itai@itaiferber.net, which I did not send.
It had a random .zip file attached, which Iâm now going to inspect in a VM. This should be funâ¦
loooooooooooooool it learned
Couldn't they load the computer with knowledge of 8th grade science?
Never heard of it. A match in what?
gotcha
arenât you in dp now?
youâre doing DP and networks as B and A rite?
jk, max one from D. but still doesnât make sense
think i pinned it down. you know the three categories of electives? iâm in a B category rn so dw thinks its done. however, the pdf for degree requirements says at least one from a and b and max one from c. so that doesnât seem consistent 
no like itâs not listed as a possibility. whatever, mightve already done that category 
at these hoes
smh
shits not on degree works
Your Amex card is no longer valid. They mailed me your new card which is a jet blue MasterCard. I will give it to u when u come down

Bc my parents left for the islands 3 hours ago 
Someone rang my doorbell and waiting then banged on the door and I got freaked out 
Ohhh
WHATS BBY
Was also just removed from my house because someone was ringing the doorbell and banging on the door at 9 PM 
I have a huge midterm tomorrow 
And we can go on a date anytime 
Haha lol he knows Christian I think? 
Lmao you saw Mikey? 
And red is goodd or anything 
Lol idk just making sure. You can hang with me and my friends! 
You're really coming!

NO ONE THINKS VIRGINIA IS COOL

FIRST YOU GO TO BUM FUCK UPSTATE NY
OMG WHY DO YOU BREAK MY HEART
I'm sad we can't brunch
Probably not
Is nasa in the city??
Thank you ma lurve ð
Do you want to meet in the market place for a little after your meeting? Like an hour tops
Let me know if you received the email with the changes
Ok it's change to the 23, only 90 bucks and no additional points charged
Yeah, it's ok. At least it would give me extra time to make it to work. What about the return flight back to Ny. What time is that?
I checked the points for the flight on the 23rd and it looks like the same amount of points
Sorry.  Ok
It's 90 to change plus a 25 phone fee And additional points to make up the the difference in price. I also checked our points and don't think we will have enough to cover  a difference. 
Ok I'll let u know what I find out
I have to check the fine print but I believe there will be a charge to cancel and rebook. That day was also a lower fare and we had enough points for that flight. 
You achieve that goal

Networks will be good
Well, at you can still use the " it isn't brain surgery" line. You can't use the "it isn't rocket science " line because it is.  Also maybe while u are there you can poke around for the classified alien photos and transmissions from the moon landings.
Thanks Erik!!!

I'd love to take ML but haven't done 447

Hi Erik. Just turned on my new phone so I'm not sure when you sent this text 
Happy pi day
I hope so
Tis a disaster 
Omg I'm sorry
Specifically Newcomb reading room 
 In library 
Also look how cute we are
It's all good
I value her friendship more than the boy so
It'll be fine
Yeeeaaahhh :(
Yeah I told him I'm not gunna try anything else and that we're gunna go back to being platonic
She just straight up isn't okay with it
It just made me realize I shouldn't
And while she didn't get mad at me like she realized she shouldn't but idk
She got upset bc she saw I was texting him last night
But it's just like bound to happen if I continue to pursue it
No
Whaaaaatever
I'm over it
And idk it's just not worth it
It was intense
Well*
We'll
Bc that shit was deadly
Only vodka?
I'm just not gunna pursue
And not well
What was in that punch
Erik
It was my anthem this weekend lol
I've rediscovered "bandz  a maker dance" didn't realize how genius it was
I'm really grateful
Thank you for being there last night man
Yea
And I was really close yesterday
I will do it if I need to
But I know that's the last thing I want
It's honestly a little blurry
I told her I was hurting a lot and that if she's just going to blatantly disregard me and disrespect me then I can't be her friend any more
But I couldn't do it
I was so set on cutting her out
Thirhse and I talked
Ight
You need any help cleaning up?
look at these texts hahahha
well apparently it was army weird hahaha
Gimme another 2!
There we go, lol yes please
Food*
Oh man, you can't ask a girl to make good decisions
Or just something greasy
I'm actually kinda down for a slice of pizza, I was craving that earlier...
Ugh
I don't remember how much was in it when we got there, but I don't think they would have finished it..
Wait it's empty?! Fuckkk, that was Annika Alex's and mine
Wait, is it still at your place?
Mhmm, solid. No more tequila
Raise your hand if you have a headache ðð»
They're after us. Hide the fascism 
Barely lol
Yes
As if the fucking speed affects the results
Other than clicking some button 
I'm like bruh id like to see you even use a gpua

Remember the little cocksucker who was like "did u train on the gpu 
I'm m coming

â¤ï¸
But good night Erik :)
If I didn't have so much to do tomorrow I probably would have crashed, that couch in your front room is mad comfortable
ð£
Yeah, we should
That's a very good question
I wish I could say it was
I find it genuinely interesting, but no not my passion
It is not
Also, awesome party, I had fun :)
Maybe it's his hidden passion, you don't know
Just pulled into BU, he's so talkative I'm so annoyed
Just me
He did not find more people
where you at
2 miles
dot worry I'll tell ya
yea it was army weird
I am wasted on my way back where are you
He's trying to find more people
I am!
Just got one
Literally still on Oak, lol gimme a sec
Lol thanks have a fun night 
Just Netflix and chill 
I'm sorry bud I'm not going out tonight 
Coming now!
:(
I'm not home. At a friends house near Johnson city. Too hard for me to get back downtown. ð
I'm early but I'm here 
Awesome 
Do you have scissors? 
I know, isn't that what you pay me to do?
I can't promise :(
Jenn's roommate Eliza is having a birthday thing tonight at 9:00 that we're obligated to go to

If we are coming, I'll let you know though!
ð
Okie
What is your address
Okay sounds good 
They're open until 9 so we'll go back before we come over 
We were just there 
They sell them at party city 
What is the likelihood that you get the hater blockers in time 
Caught me slippin at the four way...i always turn right there lol. I'm pumped about this party tonight haven't decided who i'm gonna be but either way I'll be dancing to yeezus
Was wondering if you had my drawstring bag
You on campus?
On our way 
Oh lord 
Ok we're getting he body 
Did you get the boxed blood of Christ? 
Preparing for war 
Hmm...
I think it's ridiculous, and I think it's really, really dangerous. The FBI (and the government) wants to outlaw encryption, and we're fucked if they manage to make it happen.

Like, the day we lose encryption, the day that the world no longer has democracies because we've lost the one most important right we have: the right to privacy. All other human rights are then out the window.

So, this is important.
Breakfast isn't open till 1130 I'm pretty sure
Prolly nothing you would guess I would wear tho 
It's official 
Actually nvm. I know what I'm wearing 
Lol
Not sure what tho 
I'm gonna try to come up with something else to wear 
Also... Prolly not wearing my costume. I realize now that having a real hammer and shit on me while drinking is a hazard to society 
Wow sending such a long comprehensive email for a summer intern is very impressive . I m not sure if you went before but if your close to colonial Williamsburg it's pretty cool. Did you sign the offer letter and send it back? If so don't forget to call JPM.
Ok.
You got 2 checks. I put them in your account. $690- federal tax return, $330- hackbu reimbursement .
FYI it's uncle Alex's bday today
Hmm ok. We can discuss this issue later. It's too early for this shit 
Do you have vodka?
I can do that. No problem
Dude. I'm taking a bottle to the face. I'll get a cheap bottle somewhere 
So looks like I'm drinking wine 
Also Jesus drank wine 
I feel like I'm ready to be Jesus 
I haven't slept like that in forever 
Idk how that happened 
Well...... I tried to take a nap last night around 8. Just woke up
Yesssss 
Sue Leggett saw your Facebook post about NASA. She said one of her former students is going to intern there too. Her name is Erica Lynch.

Yas betch
I'm so excited omggggg
I say c4 because I already had chicken bap today and that's basically the only thing I get from the mp lol

Probably no ones crazy, I think it's just the distance making things hard
Eh, Beau and I have just been bickering a lot lately. I always thought I was easy to get along with..I couldn't figure out if I'm crazy, he's crazy, we're crazy
I dunno, I was feeling a little crazy last night. Just wanted an outside opinion lol
In any way lol
On a scale of 1-10, how crazy am I?
There's hope 
Now there's a better chance that I'll make it 
 Wait I thought the party was tomorrow 
Maybe a miracle will happen doe 
If I can't drink I will most certainly be there dishing out cinnamon rolls 
Pray to yeezus 
I literally had to change my sheets last night because I had a fever coma and sweat through ever scrap of bed linen 
I've been in a lucid state for 24 hours
This is starting to endanger yeezus vs Jesus 
Erik I've only gotten worse 
Awesome 
Hope that's ok
Alright will do. I also invited some chicas
Do you need me to bring anything for the party?
We're moving in 10 days so really everything is about getting out of this shithole and into our nice new place, getting it painted and shelves put up and stuff before we move in, getting new furniture... You know, the boring shit that occupies adulthood

He's ALL UP IN my damn ribs today. So you know, being a baby which is cool.

You mean uncle Alex?    Well since we are planning to go to ny in the summer I was thinking we can hang with you on the drive up and down.  P.S.:  Butch is clearing this  Major Nelson, Major Healey and Dr Bellows as we speak. (Google them)
I am so incredibly proud you and so happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Congratulations!!!!!

Are u going to be in the Langley research center?
Is it close to Washington, D.C. ?
When are your start and finish dates?
Wow. Most impressive. Congrats! I'm sure you'll have a *blast* there!
Ok- it doesn't really matter because it is such a resume boost. I'm surprised it wasn't discussed.
Are they giving you free housing?
Not that it matters that much but what's the salary?
Go
To 
Way 
Are the interviews in the ITS?
Halak is out 6-8 weeks. That's at least missing the first round of the playoffs. At least they have Griess who has the best save percentage in the Nhl.
That was a total trap game. The beat Pittsburgh last night and theRangers before that . They were gassed the whole game. At least they got a point.
Yeah, to the worst team in the league. Strome scored late then took a penalty with 3 min left. Toronto pulled their goalie and they scored with a 2 man advantage .
I prefer the VHS tape myself, but to each their own ð¼

Not really
I didn't know it worked like that
Interesting
No no they're fine. You just can't stay overnight 
I can give you a better idea on Friday? 
No its a fine idea. Just don't have a 100% guarantee of what I'll be doing is all. I usually decide evening of

Travel options just need to be better 
America is the greatest don't get me wrong 
ð
Meanwhile it's $400 to fly to California for us 
Literally everywhere is between $40 and $200 
Fuckin people who live in Europe

Yoooo
Hey Erik, Chris and I are going through some budgeting stuff to figure out why we have so little leftover money. Just wanted to know, since you got reimbursed for ~$2,000, what did you end up paying for? Did you pay for any big meals?
Mhmm, maybe a little...I would just say something like you understand and hope she enjoys her weekend home
Nicely done. Helen is asking me if your friends that are coming over will need to eat / take showers etc.
GEICO Policy: Your payment of $106.37 for policy ending in 7488 will be billed to the credit/debit card ending in 6131 on 03/13. Reply STOP to end texts.

Nice :)
That will work!!!!
It's free pancake day at ihop tomorrow. I'll be there at 8am. Text me if you would like to join
This is so cute, yes 2pm sounds fine
Is this how rappers write their songs?
Lol what does that mean?
I dunno about bringing in politics, you were planning on saying something about your night then asking her about dinner right?
This is adorable
Breathe
I think mine were better, though
Wow, I forgot about emojis
Yeah I'd be surprised if girls didn't start wearing them, I was thinking about it for Wednesday its supposed to be like 70
ð¥ð¥ð¥ð¥ð¥
I will, I have two in my backpack
That's another thing, "pine" apple. Like fuck off, be original
It's too sweet, the texture of the fruit itself is weird, I dunno it's just kinda funky
I wish I could say the same
Soak in berries? Or peaches ð
I don't like pineapple
No wait don't do that
She's most likely going to the track formal that night anyway
I don't know her like that lol
I'm trying to read for OS rn and I wanna kill myself. How do I stay motivated?
Not sure though
I think I'm pregaming with Annika and Alex, then we're heading over
Yes, I'm excited
If it comes up naturally in conversation then yeah
I think most people see NASA as pretty cool, I don't think it would hurt your cause
Lol yes, #firstworldproblems
I guess my point is to just keeping reaching out, it's not easy but everything is a matter of time :)
Eventually, yeah, from throwing applications wherever I could
My solution is to cast as wide a net as possible
That's how I feel about trying to get an internship/job
â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸
it's her loss. At least you gave it a shot
 have seen it yet. and even if she did and doesn't plan to respond 
Oh shush before I slap you ð¿ she doesn't think that, she might not
Ok great. Let me know. Are your friends coming over Easter Sunday? What time?
Can you see if she checked the message?
Maybe you can try to tell them you are a full time student in Binghamton.

Oh I see your point, that's an awesome location
Did they ask you technical questions?
Their headquartered in DC, I wasn't sure
Oh really?! That's incredible :D where would you be working exactly?
Im sure she'll check FB later
That's knot a good idea
Everything will be okay
She could still be in class, or maybe she doesn't have messenger like me
No, not yet.
Ty
Ok great thank u
Yes every month $15
Question?  Did u sign up for audible in Amazon 
Oh hell yeah!! 
Got your flight info. Kickass!
U r all set to jet!!!
Double awesome! Thank you! Cant wait to see you dude. We booked our tickets. 
Ok I will book without
But I can book it with it or with out.  You can also pay at the airport if you choose to check one
It costs 25
Found flights on the 21 and 29. We had enough points for round trip
Will u be checking a bag
Excellent!!!! Keeping fingers and toes crossed.  
Ok how did the interview go
Literally unreal 
Ok great thank you
Just introducing him to me and then we can communicate from there, if that's ok with you?
Or better yet, send me an intro email and cc him
Awesome. Yes, please. Thanks.
And you don't need justification! If you think someone is pretty, then she's pretty
Lol I was stanky I had to shower
Ah gotcha, and not yet but I will lol don't you worry
What year is she?
Yeah that's a good point, bringing up the dinner question earlier is probably best. Then she knows what's up
I'd open with the first question, maybe bring up the fries after a few back and forths if it flows
"Hey, how was the rest of your weekend?" Or maybe ask her more about her internship, how she got it, something like that
I'm not sure when, maybe tomorrow?
If you're interested yeah I don't see why not, I assume Christian doesn't mind or anything
Yeah definitely message her and see what happens
Good for you :)
Lol, KPMG turned you on - that's pretty cool of her, though, it sounds like she has her life together
Where'd you meet her?
That sounds perfect to me. For small talk maybe ask her how the rest of her night went, etc, then lead into that. It's straightforward, I like it
What's up buttercup?
Sounds gucci 
Just so you can find her 
Lol I have 0 clue homie. Pretty sure single tho
Also breathalyzer for the cruise is necessary 
I appreciate that. But I'm only human 
Dude I pounded 3 bottles of champagne before 10:30 AM
I am so far from being at that point. 
Like I would rather walk on a pile of broken glass than endure this 
It's so bad. 
I seriously feel horrible 
Eh maybe 
I need a week of soberness 
But that blows my mind. Don't remember that at all
Yea she's pretty cool
I used 1.5 liter bottle.  Let it sit at room temp while it steeps
Also would like to create a login for clients and link a drop box account to it, if possible
It's a business site. Would need basic menu, graphic design, and responsive media player or way to embed links that are responsive. 
But don't remember her being with us tbh
Just cut up pineapple and vodka. Need to let it steep in the vodka for 7 days
Finance major
She's a sophomore 
Hahahaha yea I know her
Let me know if anyone is interested. Thanks
I got 500 bucks to spend
Yes paid for sure
Hey forgot to ask you on the phone before...do you know anyone who can help me make a website? And who also knows graphic design?
But count me out. I have free food here lol
 Haha just woke up from a nap 
Lol you're the best too

I'm due June 21st so it can be any time in the month around that
Yeah, I eat 6 full meals a day and sleep 15 hours so things are the same basically lol
OH, this is a totally random thought and it's not pressuring in one way or the other, but when I go to the hospital I realize your Mom and Tony won't be there but if you're in town and up for it, we'd love to see you there too.  NO PRESSURE THOUGH, don't be planning life around it
Not yet! We're not gonna announce it til he's here, people get all weird about names and once he's named, homie's named ya know.  
Making sure you are hosting half of cp for parade day
Hahaha, FOR REAL.  We even have a patio, we'll be on the first floor of a building so I can just hang out there on a rocking chair and yell at the kids in the park across the street
Wanted to check in see how it's hanging
Yea I did!

I'll just text ya when I'm done and see where you're at

So like, Taco Bell tonight?
Terrific. Have a great time. 
It should ok if you guys don't mind leaving the house before 4:30 in the morning.
I didn't take off the 28th but if your flight is at 6 , if I drop u guys off at 5 it would be plenty of time for me to come home and go to work- it is LGA?
Ok, I'm not sure where they are going to sleep. So you are coming down 3/27 and leaving the next morning? When are u coming back from the cruise and when are u going back to school?
Theoretically yes, but it depends when it is
Oh is that a real thing now? When is it?
Lol what?
You wanna get Taco Bell?

How was your weekend?
I'm feelin' it! I never really of him before, but I'm sure that's no surprise to you
Exactly but the way they are playing now I'm not sure I want them to make a move. The rumor is that they are going to get some mediocre depth so when the caps keeping taking out their players in the playoffs they don't have to  use complete rookies again.
Good times
Went to training
Woke up drunk
So drunk
I got very drunk
Looooots of fun

On my way!

I feel a lot better now just don't want to have an episode at the bar you know lol
It was really bad early this afternoon but I couldn't take my meds bc I had a test 
Yeah I'm okay it's just some days are worse than others

Idk Christian is sleeping 
Sup
You in the mp?
Thank you!!! ð 
Haha okay :) 
Yooo 
Toooo 
Plus these athletes like Marionand Schilling go broke by making  these type of investments
If he has to sell his gold medal after a very long successful career as a pro athlete to raise 35k he probably isn't that good with money and probably doesn't have much left.
He better save his money
Tru
Going hard
Next week tho
Nah I can't because this week is hell. Have to run through a presentation and make sure I don't get sick
Yeah this shit is confusing. None of us are in the loop at any point
I think it opens for everyone at some point in march
That was for regular nyu stufents
Yet
Same but I don't think class registration opens
Sounds good. I'm going to do that too but I'm not sure when registration opens
Okayyy 
Where u at 
Haha ok :)

Damn, that's incredible
That's really cool. Glad you enjoyed it
How was the Lil Wayne concert?
Nah, go fucking demolish this nap. I just mentioned sheâd be in the office today, but I think it was Alex who said he was going to go give her stuff.
Did you schedule something with her? I donât have stuff ready to go for prizes (still waiting on responses from students), nor do we have the money yet, so I donât have anything I need from her yet.
Thanks ð
ðð¼
How'd it go 
Are you guys gonna join next week too? 
:( 
Didn't hear on a preference from Ivan 
Lisa Simeon and Beth have told me they prefer next week

That sounds gud
Lol 
Alllllll day 
Ahh yes, are you free Wednesday during the day perhaps to franship?
Is your team coming tonight as well? 
After tomorrow I have all the time to franship :) 
But yas 
The only thing I really wanted to talk to them about was making sure they put things into magic on time bc otherwise Rick forwards it to me 
Lol! 
You got this? Or should I reschedule to next Monday 
Also there's no way I can make the meeting tonight ;( 
Talk about your dog! 
Umm 
Hahahah 
But asides that there are so many talented comedians that it's hard to name a shortlist
So writing wise probably him
And he writes on Workaholics and the Grinder
Well there's this guy Sean Clements who does a podcast that's super funny
My goal is to write on a tv show
Definitely want to write
Well I want to do comedy after I graduate so I concentrate on that a lot
Yeah I walked out during the middle of the midterm 
Calc 2
i hope u know that u sexy and you do really well 
CS*
I used to do CA
Are you a CS person
So what's up?
Yeah
Love making new friends
Yes very happy
Then 2 chainz after that 
I'm not a fan of future
No....
Haha okay
Maybe ask her something about dogs? Idk, people on Tinder are hard to read :/
Lol, to be fair you do have a picture of a dog in your pro pic. Maybe she really doesn't like connect4
I don't blame her, mornings suck. Also, who doesn't like connect4? Smh
Oh I forgot, maybe ask her if one of her friends goes to OCC and can get you a ticket for $25
Lol, perfect âð»ï¸

Lel, crop & post (y)
Lololololol
Can you hide the keyboard? What was the message above the Connect 4 board?
Too much of the day will be spent in the bars to risk that 
Not a chance 
Yeah a few weeks ago 
She doesn't have a fake 
Except I'm v worried about Jinju 
So much 
If not we'll figure something out 
I'm gonna ask around and see if anyone has an old ID he can use
I'm just thinking logically since you know drunk girls in the cold hate walking and that whole bridge thing last year 
I mean you can if you want but if we're going to the bars at night the girls will probably just stay here to pregame since it's closer 
Ummm I mean that's your call but it's tough to plan those things out ahead bc for example you guys didn't even make it out at night last time lol
As in like Saturday night?
Ok I feel better now 
Please don't wear a leprechaun costume 
Lol what are you wearing 
Haha I'm sure we'll invite some phi sig girls but jess' friends from home are also visiting and my other two roommates will probably invite all their friends too so it's likely going to be a very full house as it is 
I texted sad things to them bc ur working the angry angle I figured I'd work the dissapointed angle 
THEYRE MISSING MY FAVORITE DAY OF THE CALENDAR YEAR 
WHAT IS WRONG WITH EVERYONE
It's big little reveal for her  sorority 
Everyone sucks 
No she sucks too 
Honestly I don't think I can. I'm sorry man
Pals in Hawley might be throwing a big party but I'd kinda rather do the morning here and maybe go there for round 2 
I think we're just gonna have a big pregame in twin too bc it's close but if the plans change I'll let you know 
Lol yes? If that's what you're referring to 
The only one who hasn't told me yet one way or the other is Sarah but I know it's not her type of scene so we'll see if she decides to come 
Jinju Chrissy Emily Joni are the only confirmed ones 
what about logrosso 
WHY THE FUCK ISNT ADAM COMING IM SO MAD AT HIM
Which of the boys are coming for parade day?
From the 50x50 pixel image off a screen shot off your phone she looks pretty, I guess I could be wrong lol idk

I was worried you'd say that, that's why I personally jizz-sealed each bottle.
Thanks for letting me crash at your place dude. It was a fun night, as always. I guess I'll leave the beer there til next time if that's okay lol

We're almost there

Annie is coming to get me sooner than that 
Yea sleeping 
Wait, really?! Oh wow, alright
Also, do you know what time we're leaving/I need to be ready by?
Yessir I did
I like that "That's a pretty shirt, where did you get it?" Try that on campus, I think you'll get a better response
yes she can't see in the dark
You're also tall, it's hard for me to picture myself with someone shorter than me and I'm sure a lot of girls feel the same. You also have lovely green e
Your fresh might not be her fresh, just saying. I'm just telling you what I think looks good
 you were wearing that
Maybe wear your black turtleneck. It might just be me but I think you look really good in it, I'm pretty sure both times I asked you if you got a haircut
anted that night
I have definitely turned away from a guy trying to talk to me because I was focusing on having fun with my friends. Nothing wrong with him, just what I w
ing and funny and she can't see that without a conversation.
trying to stay with her friends, who knows. I don't think you'd get that same reaction if you did that at the Marketplace or something. You're very charm
To be fair, it's pretty easy for a girl to run away at the bars. A lot of people, easy to get lost in the crowd, easy to be ruder, honestly. Maybe she's 
It's for the intercollegiate broadcasting society. WNYO is part of it

And I'm always right
That's my opinion
So you're too good for them anyways
They probably can't tell the difference between girl and boys at that point of drunk
And also pretty girls our age are drunk bitches who are sloppy drunks
Especially if you have so many people who love you ya know
It's not you, it's clearly them
Don't get down on yourself for stupid girls
And we both know this is true
You're too good for them
And they're probably jappy girls
You're probably prettier than them
And you're so pretty
They're looking for stupid frat douchebags
They're not smart enough to understand you that's why
It's because they're not on the same intelligence level as you lol

Also stop the world is when you run out of memory so the jvm halts you till garbage collection can run 
I just trolled citi 
Welp

LMAO THE GUY JUST WALKED UP TO THE URINAL NEXT TO ME WHILE I WS TEXTING YOU CALLING HIM RETARDED
What are the kinds of threading in Java?

Bleh 
He didn't seem to like me
Also Citi was weird. Guy was this Indian Java obsessed weirdo 
Yeah, I guess
No, Iâll pay you back the full amount, just really surprising that it would cost that much
I guess thereâs no flower tax in NYC or something? Iâve never paid that much for flowers before, even here at Wegmansâ¦
Not to, like, shatter dreams, or anything
$50 is a bus reimbursementâ¦
Did you already buy them? Iâm not willing to spend that much on flowers.
Flowers should be $10 a bouquet, _max_
Maybe he wants to be Steve 
That's why he likes being on stage with minimalist slides and the clicker 
Itai is living vicariously through us 
Just realized something 
$50 for flowers??? How?
I should have enough cash
That too, yeah
How much are flowers?
Yep, as long as you keep an original, itemized receipt.
At least you can help them with their Big O
Smh

I'm gonna go study some econ rn. Some smart kid once told me I have to "work hard with it" so I better get on that 
Wait, are you in the marketplace?
Not very fun, but not as bad as I thought this semester would be
2 econ classes, math 371 and a literature class 
That's very true 
ls variable is already at 0. How do you know where you are?
2 creates a child on level 1 which creates a child on level 0. But when it comes back up it needs to create another 2 children on level 1, but my numLeve
Can I ask how you kept track of the number of levels in your program? Like it'll go through and create lets say 3 levels with 3 children each - so level 
ð
But you'll be fine, don't think there is much you can't do
Yeah math Nicole tells me that class is a lot of work 
How is 448? 
You did good, Mac is awesome

That's exactly the point of the exec* family â it replaces your process with a new one, so no more code will run from yours.

fork() is special in that it returns twice (once in the parent process and once in the child, with different return values), and exec* is special in that it never returns (your process is killed and replaced).

If you need to run an external process to run without replacing your own, fork() and then exec() in the child.
But you're actually the realest 
My 
U da realest nigga breathing if I hold me breath 
Am I supposed to go to the meeting thing tonight

Er, really sucks to hear you can't find the card, but no, the Foundation doesn't reimburse anything directly. You need an itemized receipt and a screenshot of your credit card statement (to show that you're actually the one who paid), but they reimburse via check. As long as canceling the card won't prevent you from taking a screenshot of your credit card statement or anything like that, you're good.
Thanks man
Yea that works
Hey Erik this is Roland. Is there any time you would be free and on campus today? I was thinking we could meet around bartle

BTW, have we heard back from Tim?
Those should only contain accepted students who are taking the busses
No, it's the individual bus list spreadsheets in "Shared Bus Lists". Should be one for RIT/Cornell, one for RPI/Albany/Siena, and one for Rutgers.
Yes, please. It can just be really quick; send them the links to the spreadsheets again, and tell them to mark people off as having arrived when they get on the bus.

Give them my cell number (347-633-1862), and more importantly, yours, for any day-of communication.
also lol that meme you sent was good
No worries, sounds good
Cool. Leaving the jerk 
Yep see u then
okay yeah sounds good
u mentioned learning python and that sounds interesting
oh haha I mean i honestly donât know that much about programming at all where i would even know where to start
idk maybe like 9 or something. i donât have that much to do
do u think it would it be worth it to go to the hackbu meeting?
hackbu is a well oiled machine 
shoutout to the fact that viacom asked about a monitor at 4:03pm and it was dealt with by 4:18pm
Oh boy 
You are high functioning 
Baller
Cool. Worst case scenario does your personal monitor have DVI? I think mine might but idk
Any possibility of Viacom borrowing a monitor for the hackathon? ITS?
Absolutely, Iâd be happy to!
Thanks <3
If they don't get back to you, we should call Uptown Limo Service
WTF, Brian?
Can you call Brian up and see if there's anyway we can swing this? Or this Tim guy and explain the situation; say that Brian never told us we'd have to get a request in 2 weeks in advance. We need this done ASAP.

If we can't do OCCT, we need to know right away so we can find an alternative in the next few hours.
That's exactly how I feel, in a more racially aware sense
Busses have been taken care of - we're all good :)
choosing Verizon.

Nah, she's dead. Crushed by obligations, I think

I'm there nothing I'd like to do more but I'm pretty sick 
Sup 
Sure thing, bb
Wrote to Marissa, Iâll see what she says.
Sounds good; going to his office would be best if you have the time.
Let me know what happens.
Of course! Weâre on the same team here :) <3
Speaking of which, any response from the OCCT guy or no? If he doesnât call you back, can you please leave him a message?
In the meantime, Iâd prefer it if you could focus on OCCT stuff. Iâll work on this in the meantime
Itâs okay! Shit happens :)
I donât mind if you do, but this is something that I want to be in pretty close control over. Not because I donât trust you, but because I want to know second-to-second whatâs going on because this is the biggest thing we need to take care of right now.
I will write her an email tonight and see if we can change the times, even at additional cost
Thatâs okay. Weâll make this work.
Did you say it in writing, or over the phone? If you have it in writing, can you please forward me the email you sent her? I just want to be able to refer to it.
I donât mind emailing her again, and I will call her tomorrow, too.

Also, weâre starting this early so people can get home early enough on Sunday.
Do you think we can change this? Do you want me to write to Marissa directly?
Even worse, theyâre all set to leave too early (12:30 PM, instead of 2:00).
Fuck
Looks like the busses are set to _arrive_ at the hackathon at 10:30â¦ Thatâs when we were supposed to start opening ceremoniesâ¦
Ty bb
Did you get an email about a siege technology  meet and greet? A friend of mine wants to go but the email we got doesn't have a location 
That's why I was asking about it now before it's too late
Ok bc I was asking adam and he doesn't thing he's gonna go
I know. I was just going with it
Ok
ð
Of course! ðð¼ð
Marissa said sheâd get the bus departure times to me, is what I mean
Talked to Marissa; she said sheâd forward it to me. Ty bb
NVM, saw it in her email footer
Thanks!
That's Marissa's number, yes? Not the OCCT guy's? (Just checking)
Still nothing from Marissa? If not, do you have her phone number? I'll call her.
Sorry, Kyle Cotter
Perf, thanks
Hey man, are people still planning to come for parade day?
Any word from Marissa about departure times? I found someone willing to be bus captain from Cornell but she needs to know when the bus is going to be leaving
Sounds good
Sounds great thanks a lot
If you could still give me a ride that would be awesome
Yo
Thanks
Big time
At the back table 
I'm fucked

Beautiful, thank you!!!
Ty bb
Can you please call him, though? We don't have much of a choice; this has to happen ASAP
BTW, any news on OCCT stuff?
Iâm definitely starting to be too
heâs paranoid about over capacity 
likely an itai thing
is down
Awe yeha dawg 
Will we get a bus To bitcamp?
Sounds good!
Look this over if you get the chance and let me know if it looks good: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15MZIh2M4dHHvMl3SHd_KMpPd0orZL2IAXctPOSpbbRY/edit?usp=sharing (This link is view-only, but itâs in Drive with the other shared bus lists)

Doesnât have phone numbers so it should hopefully be less of a privacy issue to share with students
Okay. I have to send this email out tonight, so I guess Iâll just say that weâll let them know official departure times once the bus company finalizes them.
Or are we still working that out?
Thatâs really important to let students know about.
BTW, do we have arrival and departure times for these stops?
:*
Beautiful, thank you! Iâll send this out tonight, and ask for a Cornell bus captain
I'm actually locked out of my room right now
Nah all good

Hahaha what about them??
Not terrible. Nothing really new  . How about you?
Remember when we went to that gas station and took a picture for Itai

Please do. If we need to sign a contract, weâll need it ASAP.
Depending on what you need to handle, it might just be easy enough to do manually.

Also, sweet - how do we pay OCCT?
Okay. Iâll talk to Chris about it and weâll see what to do. This is for the whole event, right (departure from campus on Saturday and to campus on Sunday)?
BTW, more importantly, did we ever hear back from OCCT? Can you please poke them again?
Sorry, just saw this. If youâre willing to wait tonight, youâre welcome to come meet me and Chris after 9:00 and come back with us to our apartment. I can help you then.

Hi buddy, Iâve updated the liability waiver, so it should be ready to print. Itâs in Driver > HackBU > 2016S > Liability Waiver; weâll need 350 copies, if you can reasonably make that many without raising suspicion. If not, let me know and we can get some more guys to print throughout the week.

They have a meeting tonight
She's the first?
Have you heard of that club that Thirhses suite started?
Yo
You can't stop me
I'm going to fundraise at the hackathon for the SPOTJAMS vanity plate
Suck it bro
Liar
Are you with john
Good
Ok?
Want to get to hackbu like 30 mins before and talk about this presentation 
Faggot
Where are you living next year
Thx
Reminder to send the updated email to Christian
i agree on the hardware lab. but how many people actually use that? also an opportunity for hackathon clubs to start acquiring their own equipment. AWS/namecheap we could frankly probably steal. be like look, youâre on a sinking ship thatâs being perceived as less cool every day.
thank you for playing devils advocate
no of course
then again if large hackathons go with it, thatâs more than enough. if itâs suddenly cool to not be with MLH all the kids at minor hackathons will want to join
not sure. then again, MLH provides little value. itâs just a brand. that would definitely be the largest threat
no corporate meddlers. focus on creation and self improvement 
literally just a website
OHL: Open Hacking League. donât take over your hackathon, just publicize it. we are not FOR PROFIT. no forced code of conduct. you report to no one, and youâre in charge of your own event

Idk
He needs to not hold on and I feel like that's what he's doing
Idk if it's a good idea honestly
Well he wants to hang out occasionally
We don't wanna be strangers and such
We both agreed we wouldn't do that
Yes
So it was hard
Which is what it was kinda
I was hesitant to go bc I kinda knew it would be like a second breakup
Yesterday but it went okay

Yeah I mean I expected it but I thought I'd try
This is so dumb it might be an Alex question, but are we doing an nyc bus?

Hey, were you the one who went to go pick up the food from Nezuntoes at Local Hack Day?
Yeah I didn't think so. Thanks erik, I'll try and figure something out
Hey Erik do you know how to set up a printer on busecure without the option to put in username and password
you da man
otherwise weâll keep it low i think
kk
how long till weâd have to make that bus decision:?
itai doesnât mind waiting 2-3 days. if we see a significant increase weâll keep the bigger bus. how close can you cut this?
cornell
hows leon from corneal?
knock the bus down to 47
one hoe from maryland - baltimore county instead of college park
Reword that however you need it, but this is the level of specificity that I want so we can an accurate estimate of the cost.
About getting OCCT stuff up and running, hereâs verbatim what I sent Alex to pass along: âThatâd be great. Weâd need to know how much it would cost to run OCCT service from campus to the hackathon that morning (so, a bus every 15 minutes from the Union from 8:45 AM until 10:30 AM), and to get back on Sunday (so a bus every 15 minutes from 12:30 PM that Sunday until 1:30 PM).â
imma get you that data so my boy erik can start fucking up buses
This seems up your ally I had to share https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoftstudentpartners
Erik!!!!
I do what I can
I need to organize myself
Bleh
Judging by the Groupme I think I still have time...
Secret penguin is then too?
Wait, when is our first peer meeting?
But yeah, that totally makes sense
"We settled down after a bit"- you dawg ð
Dawww, see?! All it takes is a little confidence, and apparently the Office lol. Good for you :) what happened after?
DAMN, that's awesome!! Was this at the bars? What did she look like?
I was thinking about binging a few things up that we loved to do but I know it'll make her really sad and idk if I should do that to her
Idk what order to ask them in
Bc I didn't see this coming
And if this is worth throwing everything we had to the side
Ask her if she's been feeling as shittily as I have
Then after my expected yes I wanna know what we're doing. Just going our separate ways or whatever
Well first of all I want to know if this is what she wants
What to u mean
How awful I've been feeling
By how I'm feeling I mean like
I wanted to tell her cuz idk it may give me some satisfaction that I'm not the only one shell shocked here
I want her to know how I'm feeling but at the same time I don't want to make her feel worse about everything
I'm kind of blanking out in what to say tomorrow
Yo
What'd you get up to?
Meh it was okay, I got my best time for the 3k but I'm still pretty slow comparatively...baby steps lol
No chance bruh?
Thesis stuff :( 
Wahh so much work! 
Good!! That's awesome to hear ð
How was your weekend?
Ayyyyy
Erik got game ð
That sounds awesome ð
Haha okay! But yayyyy! 
Oy haha I dunno if Bing bar conversations are necessarily the best indication of intelligence and interest ð
Hahaha go Erik!!! Smooth ððð
Hahahaha
Lol autocorrect!!!! Hahaha I meant to write oooh la la****
Okay waiting!
Poop oooh ðððððð
Ohhhh????????? ððððððð
I was at aepi most of the night and then Darren and I went to Dillingers for like 45 min then went home 
It's okay! I know you had other stuff going on :) what'd you do last night? I'm sorry I didn't answer 
Ya :/ 
Now I have a lot of work to do lol 
But it was fun otherwise 
Sigh 
Aepi had a party but the fun with that kinda went down the drain bc I was totally sober and my friend was having a really hard time with a break up 
But he came back last night 
Darren went home to be with his mom, his grandfather passed away last week :/ 
Shabbat was relaxing 
Weekend was good! 
I hope it works out Erik! 
I know it's really awkward and tough now though :( it always sucks when things like this happen :/ 
Okay that sounds like a good plan! 
But definitely try to be cognizant of how he's feeling 
I'm generally of the opinion that people shouldn't lose friends because of conflicts like this 
I guess in the end of the day it depends how he feels 
I know what you mean :( 
I mean I guess play it by ear 
Tough 
:/ 
Like how often do you speak to her? 
Are you close with her? 
And yeah that is always a tough spot to be in :/ 
That does sound very good :) 
Are you specifically asking if you can still be friends with the ex gf?
I mean you just need to be there to support him obviously. There isn't much you can do. Offer to listen and just be there 
Oh man that's tough :( 
Front or back
Ight lmk
What's up?
Hii of course! 
Word
Rolandos?
nice nice
It also has butch as a king, checking Bossy, which was weird. It must have been 2 weeks before the Islanders got him.
It's also had Esposito and Dionne, 4 of the  6 all time leading scorers . The were missing Hull and Jagr for the top 6.
The nhl network is showing the 1980 all star game. It has a 51 year old Gordie Howe and a 19 year old Gretzky, numbers 1 and 2 all time in goals.
Taveras won the accuracy competition. He hit 4 targets in 5 shots in 12 seconds.
Is it just a parody of jumpman?
Lol what the hell is facts by kanye

Plz answer. Idw say that. I've been shitting on him too much lately 
Fuck him
I want say "I don't see the value of demoing clarifai over any other random API. It doesn't really benefit people per se, better that they know how to use web APIs in general. There's no reason to give his company special treatment. They're not even sponsoring"
I want to shoot down Alex
You look pretty busy
Here I come
A different week then :)
Ohhh! Okay I got you 
I'm gonna deliver them if so
Nope next period. Do Tuesday is it
If so need them ASAP I need to take time sheets now
Do you have other hours on your time sheet other then Tuesday
so sorry

Let's take it into a field and smash it Office Space style
Does it sound that way with all devices, or just your phone or something?
Okie
Daytime play??
Why??
I don't think so
I guess they did an analysis and it was cheaper to buy then to lease.
Citi bought 388 Greenwich for $2billion yesterday.
I already told everyone you're coming ð
Youre coming to Hayes tomorrow night right? 
Can I haz?
I WANT 
ð±ð±ð±ð±ð±ð±ð±ð±ð±
But if you do that I have to see tomorrow then!!
You're a pussy
I'm not sure I can text you when we're leaving?
We're gonna go to bars  if you wanna meet up on state street
I like Austin, didn't know what his work was like though 
Off campus isn't an automatic no! 
Your license came. I'll mail it.
How about you? 
Idk the other kids too well 
Maybe maybe maybe Alejandra but that's a big maybe 
No one else from my team 
Haha 
Me toooooo
Bless her heart 
Beth is the only one who does it without any problems 
ð
Yeah. Lots of chasing  
All sorts of issues 
It definitely takes me more than 15 min to deal with my ResCons 
Hahaha 
So how long do you put down for logsheets/end of pay period check ins and whatnot? 
It's ok! :) 
Eriiiik
Wooooo I wanna meet your friends!
At the social place thing you were telling me about?
ill ask caro where sheâs gonna go because sheâs housing me
Iâm coming
donât be a bitch
where?
swag
Iâm coming to bing today
Was dealing with the printer thing and I have to run to class :( friendship soon? Come to Hayes this week! 
How long do you put down at the end of each log sheet for checking in with your team and going over shit? 
Is it in the engineering building? 
Ooh actually I might be able to stop by at 4 
Duh it's purple!!
How are you Erik? :) 
Found it lol 
Also I can't find the spring logsheets? 
Birthday present since my birthday is during hack bu??? Hahaha ð
And if there's a purple one this year I'd totes do anything for that 
But I've wanted the ones from last year forever they're so soft ð
I have help desk hours then class :( 
Are the shirts purple this year too? 
Haha on the help desk sign ð
I want!!! 
Purple hack bu sticker????????
I think I'm good, there's too much going on
Oh, as far as rescon plans I'll be off campus next year, so I guess I'm out
I feel less functional
I don't even remember c
ðð¼ðð¼
I'd say 56 people
Between RPI and Albany I think we can fill it up, no? Have you gotten any responses from RPI people directly saying they'd want to send students?
I'm in class ð¬
I thought there was lab...
I'm not in 320 lol
At least he can get some things right 
/uj this is not acceptable to tell the freshmen
Gains. I'll be in touch for sure. Chilling in FL with you is a main priority of mine, muah muah!
don't want it to seem like I'm just going away all the time, you know. 
I will as soon as I can. Only reason I haven't booked yet is because I'm trying to time it right when I can tell my boss. I'm going away next week, so I 
i agree 
 you...near end of May
Pretty much yes. Sorry I forgot to tell you. I still have to alert my job before I can purchase the tickets but it's gonna be those original dates I told
and ok. when you go, text me
thatâs definitely true
also when were you going to 240? i can come
Cool 
Gotta have that live feedback 
But have fun at the bar. How about during the hackathon every once and a while we go in a corner and jerk/talk about what's going on 
I'm the delegation monster 
Nah that's not 301 I feel like. More management/engineering theory probably 
Can't wait for Itai to be lame duck
Fuck
Dependency management 
That timeline
That assigning of tasks tho
That Gantt chart tho
Teamwork looks so sweet
It's cool bc you and I also have fairly natural divisions of labor. I never worked on external stuff at all. 
All this is after feb obviously 
Yea
Like if we want to build a job board (don't talk about this with anyone right now) I'll have my guys do it with formal software like teamwork
I'd talk about this with you first but I might try out some different techniques with my team this spring to prep for next year and see how it works
Itai is obviously amazing, but it's amazing anything gets done
I'm not joking 
And chipotle at the hackathon 
We will have enterprise level project man agent systems for the team 
Have you ever heard of a fucking Gantt chart??
You know what I realized? This is a retarded mess
Call me any time in the next half hour-hour if you want to circlejerk 
There's no one I'd rather do it with
This will be the conclusion and highlight of our college careers
We will easily be the best hackathon ever put on here and possibly in the best of all time. BU does rank in between MIT and Harvard in mlh. 
It will be better, not worse than ever
I also officially decided as of today that I'm super excited for next year. We are both highly competent people 
I was just gonna circlejerk with you
"Uuh I'm at a dinner for m-" SHUT THE FUCK UP
Meeting
Our
Forgot
Fucking
Alex
Ok. thanks
Like you're guaranteed to be at the Erik ones?
Confirming that the classes in doc are the ones you ARE going to and the ONLY ones
 don't wanna buy one
Also do you have a calculator that isn't graphing that you can lend me?
Is that for realsy?
Omg
Yes of course!!!!
I'll be out fri and sat this semester as long as ik
Healthy
SPIRITED
She's sick lol and I so would but I'm at bball game
lmfao ikr
action figure! I was so excited when I saw it lmfao I had to purchase it, since I love the zelda series 
I know you're not a big zelda fan but I thought you'd like to see this. I went today to gamestop to buy a wii u pro controller and I found this 20" Link 
Lol, I won't drop it but I'll be sure to write that on my soot survey
 fifth grade, too ð
I learned about stem and leaf graphs today. I learned about them in
I have yet to see her smile. She said something mildly funny and half the class laughed and she just continued on, deadpan
Sadly yes :(
ðð¼ðð¼
Probs not
Do you know any other schools along the way? (I don't, off the top of my head, but if you do we can potentially add them...)
Goodnight :)
Shhhh you're beautiful, Erik
All guys have the same hurdle, you're not the only one putting in effort. Just jump as high as you can and let the rest take care of itself
ð¬
Girls are too big to fit on a silver platter
Just putting yourself out there and in situations to strike up conversations is perfect, keep doing that and you'll be fine
That's awful
Nooooo
Thursday night?
Lmfao completely agree
:(
But I may have to take my manual exam early Thursday so trivia may be a no go now
Why wouldn't it be? Lol
Props for going up to her, though, that's not easy ðð¼
Nice!
Ayeeee! :D
Damn ð
Wanna come?
My room
What do you do to deal with Rick?
We're still going :/
I think just reading, I'm pretty sure it's on blackboard
Not coming lol

Wanna get foods?
Hopefully by 7 ð¬
I have a bit of work as well tho
That's awful
That might just be crazy enough to work 
Okay lol, I'm stop by when we finish up
I may meet you later
Damn Erik
Are you doing work already
How long will you be there? I have to meet with Annika Sofia and Alex for club stuff at 6
Or maybe just some ikea furniture 
I'm going to build a squat rack
MAYBE
Ok
Should I register for hackbu without ideas and talent 
Gotcha okay sounds good
Okay, that's fine
We can probably even let her know tonight after our meeting
Ty, I'll take a look
swerty swerty
I know it's late but it's the only free time we have
plz do the thing bb :*
Also, would you be free to meet for HackBU tonight at 9:00-ish?
She still hasn't given us a deadline? We need a deadline ASAP
Also yeah, we've got $23K
Coming in a minute! 
Text me when you're heree
See you there! 
Haha okay cool so I'll go straight there then 
When are you heading over there actually? Should I go home first? 
No I'm good thank you!! I'm waiting for the 7:30 bus :) 
Sounds perfect
Yaaassss
Tho*
We can still get turnt thro
I'm so maaaaaddddduh
Idkkkkkk
I want to go though
Idk
I think
It's cancelled!
We must bond soon
Hbu?
Pretty much
Ay boy, I currently have a Monday Tuesday Thursday schedule
Okay, seems like everyone should be free tomorrow evening; just confirming when Jack will be available. Can you ask Chris what time works for him?

As for reimbursement, itâll just be easier to post now, promote it with your card now, and just save the receipt and get reimbursed.
Tomorrow night for what, meeting up? (If so, I agree, just need to figure out what time everyone is free. When do you get out of class?)
Also, $10 should be plenty to promote the post to everyone we can reach.
Hey, awesome! Yes, we should. Do you know how to do that?
Also, when are you free to meet tomorrow, if at all, to discuss HackBU stuff? Is your evening free?
Lol
Hey Anthony, it's Wilson from UFC Gym. How did you like everything yesterday?
All good though bro. 
Incredible how that shit works huh?
Thank you anyways, Erik. You're a great friend. 
 Won't make it*. Don't come. I got another ride. 
Won't make it yet. 
Says 26 minutes. 
Thank you my nigfa 
Ahhahaa 
The fact that you're even waiting til then is the nicest thing ever 
I 100% understand. 
Absolutely not a problem dude. 
Thank you so much man. 
Word. 
It's saying 44 minutes. 
Kk 
What time you got class?
 It says about an hour. But the way this mother fucker is driving, it can be much faster and I can def be wrong. 
Lmao 
This was the fucking dumbest and longest day of my entire life. 
I had a dream that I was a football announcer and commented on a play by one D'Marcus Allenclad Jr. It was important to me that I told you this lol
Loved that shit
High school floor hockey was bomb 
Hockey is a fun sport to play.

Oh cool, hah, yeah it's a fun time. I used to be good when I was younger. Now I have so much MASS it's hard to move around out there, (jk) but it's comin

I'm a pussy
Nvm I'm gonna buy the books
And hibbler mechanics of materials 9th edition
I need hibbler dynamics 14th edition 
The meal prep you mention is what I do as well. It's the best approach to staying consistent. Think about that offer. I gotta run. Talk soon!
Check check sodium and other sources on the chicken. Sometimes that stuff is low grade meat, and salt heavy
Yes sir
grams of kale, and splash some apple cider vinegar into it for taste. Either or works :) hope this helps.
been adding 1 heaping tbsp of coconut oil and mashing it into the tuna lately for more taste and better consistency. Alternatively, I used to mix in 100 
Hey! I typically use 7oz can of chunk lite tuna in water, and mix it with half of a 15.25oz can of kidney beans. I drain both cans before mixing. I have 
Okay good! Sleep well :) 
Got home okay?
Thank you Erik!! 
Just woke up from my nap, no it doesn't cost anything but there's a facebook thing you can enter on to get a free drink. I'm headed there now

Yea, I guess it depends on who you use most consistently :/
Upstairs! 
Best character to smash with?
Jen says Shalom aleichem!
Jen David and a bunch of Hayes people 
I'm there already for the last hour! 
Dillys?
It's a business where you can sell gift cards that you don't want and they just made a deal with barnes and noble (bu's bookstore) so you can use old or unwanted gift cards to buy your books. And they're having a launch party at Dillingers. Bout to nap to prepare for it
That's fucking awful, Jesus Christ ð
Party starts at 12 at Dills for card cash, i'm not sure if i'm going yet

Wow. That chubacca snuggie last night. You're clutch ty for that also

Taveras finally scored. I think Boychuk is back after the all star break.
Isles got Hammer back last night and he played really well.
Where should we go?
Dinfast it is. I always get eggs anyway
Yeah, at least they'll get a good year out of him.
Oh good call, I'll be back by tomorrow afternoon - wanna do Sunday night dinner?
I'm actually heading up to Syracuse today, I'm taking off soon :/ bro brunch before class Monday?
Well, I still stand by a lot of girls have nice butts
Mhmm
You'd bang 50-60% of the girls on campus right? That means 50-60% of butts are acceptable
Not really, a lot of girls have great butts
 Having the worst night of her life and didn't want to talk to anyone? You never know
ithout it, she might not have been as pretty as you think. You also can't take her walking away personally - maybe she had a bf? Maybe she was plastered?
Aw, Erik, don't even think about her. For one, if you could tell she was wearing makeup she was probably wearing a lot. Girls can look really different w
Proud of it 
You are correct 
I was very drunk for no reason 
Why you ask?
Yea just dropped Bob off at home

I got in and was redirected to the quikpay site and Now I can't get into quikpay with the user id n pw
hold on hold on I need to see which one bc some of those r my moms
thanks you too!
THANK YOU ERIK!!!
I see now I entered ur id incorrectly 
Don't worry about it, happens a lot to me too. :) :P

Haha, I actually wanted to ask you to ask her when they need to know by. I think registration can open today, so once it does, we (you + Tim + whoever) should let RPI, RIT, and Cornell know so we get signups from them. The more we get the sooner we can finalize the busses.
red Cross lmfao

Hey are you down to trivia tonight?
That's not a bad idea. Would you mind checking with the Sharethebus lady to see if extending the RPI route would be possible/how much extra would it cost?

Then we'll see how many folks sign up from which schools and plan accordingly.

Lmao, that's understandable, skiing is scary at first. I miss it a lot :/ where'd you go?
Those routes sound good enough for me; I dunno, what do you think? Can we fill a whole bus with RPI folks, and another one with RIT + Cornell?
yes sounds good! I should probably pack that... :)
Hey bud, just a quick question: for the different bus routes (RPI & RIT), which schools are we hitting there? Can the RPI bus stop at Cornell? Does the RIT bus stop anywhere but RIT? I want to open up registration as soon as Jack can get it up, and I want to know which schools we should focus on hitting most (those we can get busses to). 
aww okay that's fine then!
hey Erik!! so it's ok if you can't, but what are the chances that you can give me a ride up on Friday? I'd provide entertainment in the form of bad singing ð

âGotta go with Kendrick, Iâm just saying. I think Drake is an outstanding entertainer but Kendrick, his lyrics, his last album was outstanding. Best album I think last year,â Obama said.


âThis one? This is your final answer? You donât want to phone a friend?â

âThis one is a little too conservative. Too much. Too much fabric,â Obama said.

And the President also weighed in on flexed his pop culture muscle by choosing Kendrick Lamar in a rap battle, at least against Drake.


ââThe American people really want to know this one,â Thorne said during a round of pop culture questions. âIf you had to pick a pair of pants for your dog, A or B?â

âNo, you gotta go with this,â Obama said, pointing to the second photo of a dog wearing pants on two legs, and rejecting the four-legged version.â
âAdande Thorne, also known as sWooZie, asked the president about an Internet meme created by Maxim Magazineâs Jared Keller.â
did you hear about obama and the kendrick thing

ave time? Did my dad talk to you about it? 
Hey, I know you and Chrissy are going to dinner tonight, could I send her with Lydia's computer to  give to you if you could take a look at it when you h
Various things with various people
Lots
Yeah, basically. Because it's Excel, you can't really interface with it programmatically; all you can do is sort of take screenshots of it really quick.

You could get lower-level and write a driver that makes the Oculus appear as an external monitor, and then any application windows that get rendered on that monitor are up to you to render (so you can do anything you might want with it), but now you're writing a driver and that's poopy.

The other scenario that I can think of is writing a VM in which Excel can run (and then you control the entirety of the environment in which the program runs), but now you're writing a VM which is even poopier.

Basically, it's possible, but with a _lot_ of work.
Basically... Not really possible, unless you could make those programs web apps and just have web views on the sides of this GL cube.
It makes sense, but depending on how you're looking to do it, it's not possible.

So if you have a program A, you can't just arbitrarily embed it in program B and have program B show A's UI. For this to work, you'd have to either run A offscreen somehow, take a screenshot at 60 FPS, display the image within B, and have B send all clicks and stuff to be simulated within A. That would be incredibly taxing and inefficient.

If program A and program B are written together (and can be designed and written simultaneously), you can do some cross-process communication to have A tell B how to render its views and such, but that's a ridiculous amount of work. I've only ever seen one implementation of this done, and it's internal to Apple's frameworks. It's a huge burden to maintain.
Text me next week or I'll text you and if it works it works
I'm more of a sporadic type of gal
I usually bail out of those lol
Let's not make plans ahead of time

Jenn and I both miss having our own space and not being confined to tiny rooms at our families' houses.

Also there's lots of HackBU work to be done and I want to get started with stuff before the semester starts.
I guess. I can't figure out how to send emails in the folder
Didn't get that far. I read that you had to create a filter to send multiple emails but it didn't pick up all the emails we had in that particular folder 
I did and I can't figure it out. Need to create filter but we have emails in a folder and the filter did not pick up all the emails in the folder. 
Do u know how to forward multiple emails in Gmail such as emails contained in a folder (label)
I'm coming back to school tomorrow, so I'll be there by the time you get back. :)
I know, me too! <3 I miss you, handsome.
When are you coming back to school?

Sounds good chief
Yea I think so lol, enjoy the movie chief
Come here and chill, possibly kaboodle it
Yea want to chill
Good for you
I remember telling you that I couldn't do this.
Are you going to do it?
Oy
Yes ð I mean, I haven't seen him since finals week but yes :) I'll probably see him next week 
Why are you making this so difficult? 
My new years was awesome :) sad I wasn't with Darren for it but I had fun with friends in the city :) 
Stay strong! 
ð
I would like closure on a lot of things and I think the only way I can get that is by talking to you about it.
I'm sorry Erik :( 
Yeah so definitely stay away then 
Really doesn't **
Does she really not remember or do you think she's just trying to make excuses to meet up?
So tell her that 
I'd say tell her you think it's a really bad idea to keep talking or something 
Meh talking won't do any good :( 
If you don't want much to do with her then don't! 
How did you guys end up hooking up? 
Oh boy :( 
What's happening? 
We never talked! 
You texted me what happened. I need fucking answers
Erik. I remember virtually nothing from that night. I need to hear you say to me what happened.
seriously
I'm not playing this game. I need to talk to you in person
What happened the other night
I just need to talk to you in person. When are you free
Ellen says we can hang around 10
I have a rehearsal dinner at 7. But until then nothing
 Hey bud. Just chillin
I think you know. When are you free
Plenty of things
You owe me at least that
Can you make the project public whenever you get a chance?
I need to talk to you in person today
And perhaps some miscellaneous siblings
Meet my kitten and dog
Idk I've been to Long Island you haven't been here so I think it'd be more fun for you to come here
Uhm
And Lydia is coming for some reason, god dammit
Ok, Kaitlyn is going with us
Lol just got this now, sure
We'll set a day in stone when I see you
Sounds perfect to me
Well if at any point this week you wanna chill aside from our NYC Friday meetup, let me know
:D
Yessir
Because we both have perfect taste
It's exactly why we're friends
Like after we get down to the lake
I love margheritas
Sounds phenomenal
I'm sorry. I need to know what happened exactly
Any time my frand. So what are your bday plans?
It puts you in a bad place and that really sucks, but don't be mad at yourself for this one. If there's anyone to be mad at, I would say it's her.
r of those things
Idk if she's making you feel any bit guilty, but hopefully not because it's her responsibility to be loyal to her gf and honest to you and she was neithe
hings happen. It's an awful situation, but you're not at fault here, she is.
And you're not. Listen, you didn't know she was still in a relationship. There's not reason for you to feel guilty. Even if you did, you were drunk and t
you last night about things and seemed upset so maybe they should check up on her. Then if she decides to tell them she can.
Hmm yeah I mean, I think it may be a move to reach out to one of her friends. You don't have to tell them what happened but maybe just say she vented to 
So are you still talking to her, or are you wondering like what exactly you should say to her or what?
Don't apologize lol I'm more than willing to take all of the venting you need to get out
Ugh Erik that sucks so bad. I'm sorry :/
Damn that was good of her
She doesn't remember much as in she doesn't remember hooking up with you?
Oy that's quite the pickle
Yes you have
Of course, shoot.
Why so serious?
Hi Erik, happy new year
Well i just got broken up with and now I'm going to go to fucking cvs for plan b so don't fucking tell me it's going to be fine

Are you fucking kidding 
Did you use a condom
*at 3

Yea, but we'll bombard him afyer
Jimmy can't make it though :(
Ah lol, 10 o'clock
Not too shabby, did you get toms group text
Chief what's up
Are you seriously telling me we had sex
and then
I need you to tell me what happened
Did you try to stop me
I'm sorry
Did I initiate it? 
Seriously, is there any way we can talk on the phone? Or I can come and drive by for a second. I'm just running errands and I don't want to text and drive
did anyone see us? I kid you not Erik, I remember very very little of what happened so I'm trying to piece it together
Yeah sorry I was just driving so I needed to park
Can I call you
So no one knows, you know that for sure
can we talk? 
What are you doing
You're right
So, what happened big dawg

I had a really bad day so I'm not going out
Hey there friend
Eh, a little
I know what you mean, though. I'll try
This is going to be my lowest GPA in a while. I don't think there is an "enough"
Idk. Send everyone my love, at least â¤ï¸
Everyone says that to me :/ I honestly just don't know what else to do. I feel very stuck and frustrated sometimes..
Nah
I am glad you had a good time ðð¼
hink I'm over it
Ya :/ I guess I was a little irritated earlier. "You're such a loser Amanda, look at all the fun I'm having without you..." It kinda hit a nerve, but I t
Mhmmm
You at the CS party?
Good
Ya
Glad you had fun!
Yeah it's fucking stupid and I have to start automata tomorrow
Ints
I can't seem to figure out of to take averaged properly n dimensionally since sometimes the arguments passed are lists and other times they are into
It's still really fucked up and I think I'm just fried. Can you look at it when you get a chance? I think the main problem is the average function
ð
What?
Nvm, got it
How do I Venmo you? Do I add your email?
Come
mlm
Shut up lol
I agree
I'm getting a lot of that
Let me studyyy
I already told her
I don't believe so, I'm sorry :( I'll either get like a Bish or a C-, depending on my final, I gotta go in
:( mhmmmm
I'm going to finish up the coding today. I only have to do the average function
Do I fundamentally suck if I decide to stay in tonight? ð¬
lol
yes she did lol
Lo siento por favor
Probs wouldn't have brought it regardless 
Not a fan of lube
Not so sure

That's fair
Sorry :((

Bleh. I just deposited a check at M&T so I had enough money on my card to Venmo you back. Then I went to check my account balance on my phone and nothing
B
Yeah that sounds good, maybe the company will pay some of the cost.
Ok, yeah, it depends how you feel. If you arent sick of school after 4 years go for  yr masters.
We'll be pals forever 
Not child's play
#stupididiot
And so they have a stupid idiot like you do it
Something a professor or phd student needs for research but they don't have the time to code
It's usually a large scale implementation of something 
5 is for faggots
If you're not really interested in research do the 4 and project 
3 and a thesis
remember when they always used to talk about âsurface reconstructionâ fuck that
choosing Verizon.

Come back to me already sheesh
It was the only thing wrong with your statement
Your grammar just killed me
I support the hashtag
Over achieve
Just go to both
Oh wow I'm a dork, I was looking at the wrong thing yes I'm in A
Wait are Josh and Jim in A?
No you're not, you're trying to get into section B

Kill 'em â¤ï¸
Ah gotcha
Oh wow that's intense, good luck!! Is it over Skype?
And yeah I guessssssss, not happy with the grade though
Mhmmm dammit, okay let me know when you decide
Wait, did you accept at JP Morgan yet?
Ehhh, alright I think? It was 25 multiple choice, the annoying "all of the above/none of the above" kind. It was fair, though
I see u
By tossed
okie I'll have my friend carry out out for me
Autocorrect messed it up a bit
Say that again
But it's so necessary
Might die
I shouldn't. Meal plan would suffer
To get coffee or not.......
At a table at the market place mi amigo
Okay well I'll let you know my where about
Way to let the team down Erik
sounds good! just text me before you're here I'm on the ground floor. and no you're not you're the best for helping me
What do u think?
I haven't decided yet because places will be packed
You down for a study sesh?
Yes
I was about to ask you the same thing
in endicott for the rest of the day so come whenever is good for you!
Lmao we were laughing for so long at all of them
Okay so at least a little positive. Gooood luck Erik!! You'll slay as u do w everything. Sending good vibes
I have one Friday and one Monday. Not too worried it's one of my easier semesters so yay for that. How u doing- stressed or lax
I didn't have any today so pretty good haha- hbu?
Lmao dying
Still counts
Ah i thought you hacked a random person
My diffeq final #strugglebus
I feel that. Noo don't be sorry-- thanks!
What are chances you know how to use the math website Desmos
On your snap story
So whats the story with thst laptop
Ohhhh gotcha
<3
probs around 5 if you're good with that
ok no problem mom has just been bothering me
Perf, ty boo
ok
Lol what?

lol wanna get it tomorrow then?
yeah that's fine!! I'm done with class around 330
I just gotta pick up a test after class and then I'll be in my room!
You're gonna have to help me pick one out
We need a 1/2 horsepower motor lmao
$
The motor might be like 100
I hope I don't lose this paper within 8 months...
Idk what that means in terms of energy output
We're gonna need a motor that can pull like 150 newtons
Wow ok lol
After that it just needs a forward and backward switch honestly
We would need to ask permission for someone else's deck to stabilize it from wind and whatnot
The two top pulleys would be connected to our ledge
True that
We gotta come back like August 1st and make sure we make it and use it so we can be the shit
We could get like an arctic blizzard and never use this shit
I'm sitting here drawing sketches and this could be one huge waste of time
Cuz he is one
Morgan might know how to work tools
Yeah then no
Noah can do math..?
Cool
Motor arduino etc
Yeah we need a steel cable, some bolts, a pulley, a basket thingy, a 10lb weight and the electrics
24.251 lbs
Wouldn't it be easier to do calculations in metric
Lmfao
Little less than 11 kilos
A 30?
12 cans?
How much weight should our elevator be able to carry?
Dang
Or we could like go up and get it ourselves...
I'm watching arduino elevator videos on YouTube
We're gonna be so high tech
Program the arduino to pull a spring back to a certain force and launch it to the couch
And the guy on the couch wants a beer
If someone's in the kitchen and another is on the couch
Arduino powered beer launcher
New idea
Next to an outlet
We are by jazzmans
Ok, just curious. It's their corporate headquarters. It's pretty cool. It's in Times Square.
You got your geico ins ID cards in the mail.There r in your drawer. Put them in your car by jan 13.

10:30 bus
The place?
Lol Ight
*tn
I'm going to but just for Barry's act
Ok I guess I'll feel it out tomorrow
Yea I mean it's possible but I'm more leaning to studying for finals
Lol nothing idk why she told you that
Yeah I just feel bad if we get coaches and then we don't coach other people
Bruh
I mean I'm saying, we need to practice and run it also though
Yeah I feel that. I just really can't stay for SOOO long. 
Idk. What are your feelings?
Do you definitely want to meet at 11 tomorrow? A part of me does, but at the same time I don't want to change anything about our scene I just want to practice what we've worked on
Okay imma brush my teeth be out in a hot sec
Lmfao
Okie faaaaaaam
We have a five dollar limit for a secret Santa in my suite so a 5 dollar gift
Can't. Wait.
How was your night last night?
Yassssssss
I have dinner with the suitemates at 630 so as long as I'm back before then
5 would be ideal but I can do earlier if you need to
Uhmmm
lemme know if you can do Walmart!
Are you sure I don't need a resume?
Sick
Lmao yes tomorrow would be fantastic ð¬
Lmao sushi
Study zone*
I said late night bc I didn't wanna go until I got my studying done
Nah it's cool I'm in the sushi zone
Are you still going out?
Yes
Here
I can't do early evening, perhaps tomorrow at some point if you are available and not terribly hungover
Ahhhhh you're going out tonight
What are your thoughts on a late night Walmart trip tonight ?
^Sorry, just saw that ð¬
Proceed
You ever browse r/swoleacceptance
I really got your back
Don't worry bro
Don't worry I got your back bro
I'm going to tell him
Her boyfriend is that big man I lift with
Haha you're a bastard
Yeah that works, thanks!
Yeahhhhhhhh
I'll keep trying
Yeah, I was thanked for my interest :/
ily
if dank kush tweeted it it would be hilarious but also no longer a secret
i think pranking his laptop somehow might be more straightforward
would also need a sound systemâ¦
do we have a projector?
hmm
OHHH boy
Yeah so what's the most serendipitous location to find that
Why is this a convex hull problem if they want to get around an object?
Get wrecked
This guys kind of a baller
Run it though real quick to make sure it runs with two clusters
No just use the code from git hub and we don't have to switch laptops
Demo something you didn't write? Nigga...
Ight
What's the complexity for clustering? Your slides didn't display well on my machine
Another fucking A* presentation
We also have write a 4-6 page paper apparently
Yeah I seem to have disregarded some stuff when I wrote it.
Yeah this only works for 2 clusters I just realized
Sure
We'll just run it with two and call it a day. Also wouldn't even know how to do that dynamically with matlibplot
Yeah so there's that
Also the visual representation only plots for 2 clusters
Yea
Well when you put it like tht
Yeah, take the JPM and then back out if you have to.
It actually only runs in two since my distance function is fixed to two variables. We can just say that it's easily scalable
You're a whore
That's the plan
Probably get there by 435. Finish the lift around 615
Straight to ironworks
Leaving campus around 415
Go to the gym with me
Especially if those plans are lift and food shopping
It's just that I'm selfish and refuse to alter my plans for anyone
WE ARE
NO
ERIHK
NO ERIK
And I ate a wegmans sub
I have to lift and go to wegmans
I can't 
Are you still a giant pus
How is your semester turning out
How are you
Yes sir *salutes*
fun then
Lol, afraid as in "unfortunately I haven't." Once break hits I'm literally doing nothing but laying in bed all day eating Cheetos, I plan to catch up on 
I have not had the chance, I'm afraid :/
It's a hot mess, though :/ I think I can fix the seg I have now, if I run into another I'll send it to you
I'll keep you posted though
Ehhh I need all the help I can get but at the same time it's so hard to explain my code, if I keep going at it I'll probably figure it out
I considered taking shots before coming down here, I might do that tomorrow to ease the pain
Aw damn, I wish I was
Project due tomorrow night, lab due Friday
Hbu?
Debugging/still writing 240, I'm in G7
Lmao oops, yeah I've seen that before I forgot
ð¬
I am still lost...don't guys make the hot-crazy scale ? I can't place myself on that
^What do you mean, I thought a 6 is a 6...
Huh, I expected at least an 8. I'll take it
Where am I on the crazy scale?
Mhmmm, sounds weird. I don't think there's a comparable term
What's the male equivalent of 'hoe'?
I choose the students 
I've simply chosen sides
NO IM NOT
You would let me
Why would I not be
What?
Yes
It was all good
 Haha no
no
I have bio tutoring
thank you
There's a spy
Just left
Maybe school
Money
Bitches
Alcohol
and my needs
but what about me????
yay milena because love her
BOOOOOOOO
It won't work in multi dimensions since pretty much all the code is in the if statement. That's an easy fix though
when do you get home
hey honey
I'm counting on you
We need a name for the apartment next year
Awesome! Yeah we're not gonna need the whole time. Matt and Alison can't but you can offer
Thanks I'll check it out when I get a chance
In the success center
Yes
Shit autocorrect
Ya*
You're welcome to join if us want
Nowl*
Possibly later but rn I'm doing work underneath bowl
Uhhhmmmmm
No
I did already
I'm not sure...I don't think so though

Sharon is back too
I do what I can
Ahhh, I knew it was something. Looks good ðð¼
Also, did you get a haircut?
Will do
Switching to FB, battery low
Mhmm, at least Tommy would be proud
Where do I make like ability as a string?
Where do I set it as an int?
In my main, under the ADD section
Don't spend anymore time on this, you have so much stuff to do too. I have no clue what's wrong, I'll ask my TA in lab tomorrow
Ughhh
It ran for you though?
Weird, it won't let me run that
oooo true true hang on
My heart literally started racing
Second to last line in what?
Is printSongInfo written alright?
You love math jokes 
Ugh
I know the array size is one hundred
Idk
 error when I tried to put newSong in, not just when I wanna print
That's my guess too...but if I take out the cout line with "printSongInfo" the program runs fine. If SongArray[i] is null, I feel like it would call an
Dis reminded me of u 
Wait, are you on campus?
I don't think I need to touch it there, I just set the maxSong size on line 92
The INIT command? Yeah I know that runs, I had to do that and test it awhile ago
The username can either enter commands on the command line or they can pass in a file and the commands will be read from there
It's initialized to 100, I'm only adding 3 songs :/
The INIT command in my test.txt initializes the maxSize of the songArray
I'm guessing my songs aren't adding and I'm trying to print something that's not there, but line 30 on Pandora.cpp should be working, I don't get it
I have the print statement in "add" function on Pandora.cpp, so it's tripping there
Pandora.cpp, when I try to print out the song information of the songs I've added to the heap array. I wanted to see if my adjust heap is sorting them correctly
Do whatcha ya gotta do lol
I like to keep things accurate
I sent it, don't judge me I've never done a heap ð¬
Smh, I knew I should have kept the penis
That's crazy
Fuck
Wow
Not all about the money, I get that
And yeah I guess that's true, JPs offer seemed pretty handsome tho
My codes pretty messy :/
240's going I guess, I'm trying to see if my max heap is working but I'm seg faulting so I can't tell
I thought you preferred JP regardless?
I'm pretty much psychic
I think you mentioned it was coming this week, when you texted me it popped into my head for some reason and I was right
Lol congrats though that's insane!!!
^I had a feeling
How was yours?!
Also seg faulting :/
Mehhh so so, I'm in that mental state where I know I have so much to do but it hasn't quite hit me yet
What's up buttercup?
192-919 is your Stripe verification code to use your payment info with Pushbullet.com.
Hi 
It's the 3rd paragraph down in the "about JPM "section.
I'm at lot t
Yeah I'll be there in a minute 
I get out of class in 5 minutes ill be outside dickinson
We ain't in it I swear
By the women's bathroom
Go to the old Union
We left
NOOO
The letter says you have till Dec 21 accept by signing the letter.  I guess you can try to stall JPM till after the holidays but you still wouldn't hear from Bloomberg till acouple of weeks after the interview. I guess you're going to have pick one and back out if you get Bloomberg.
Where u at
It just says ny metro area. Citi didnt specify the exact location either just ny, Long Island city and Jersey city which are its 3 main hubs. Citi did specify ICG. JPM' s brokerage is massive. I guess you can technically be on the bank side W/ JPM since they didn't specify. The offers seem very similar.
When do you have to let JPM know by?
I haven't seen anything about Murph yet. Did u get the offer letter from JPM?
What do you mean?
Well we have had it.  Just haven't done much in past few years.  
We are official u know 
Check out the website when u have a sec.  Another thing to add to resume!! Lol
ð
I know I have log in information 
I don't know. It's not urgent.  I'll find out the info so u can go look. I don't have anything to update yet but hopefully over the next few weeks 
Just to add a few things    
I need to update it    I don't even know what program the guy used before.  
Would you date a girl taller than you?
Lolol
You into that?
Mhmm, fair enough
I haven't been on Tindr in forever, what else is new on it?
Hahahaha, that's great
Super liked?
Any prospects?
Ah, yes that's a clear sigh
Can you even say her name correctly?
I will. I'll probably do it during algo tomorrow
Not yet. I want to make some changes but the coloring and plotting stuff is easy
Ok then it's pretty much done. I'm going to work on it a little tomorrow and see if I can get it to be animated because it'll be cleaner and look cooler
You want to generate a new graph every time we update?
So animating this is a bitch. Have you ever used Jupyter?
Would u be interested in helping me with our website 
Go for it
Lol
You played no role, I did that to myself! I remember you got me a drink but I don't believe I drank that much. James kept buying us shots too
Why you?
I couldn't even look at the bottle of Smirnoff on my desk, I had to throw a tshirt over it
Mayyyyybe
Lol
Damn, that's rough :/
Were you hungover this morning?
a is a thing, I should go there more often
The kitchen and living room, it takes fucking forever ð I forgot a

Yeah I just whipped one up. Ok cool I should be good to do it now thanks
Never mind I see. We only visualize if it's 2D
Ok I'm not sure how that would be plotted
Are the x and y coordinates in data?
Got it
Have you run it?
How do I run your code
Yeah

No no your doing it wrong
You plug it in and then use it to look at tits dummy

"Our culture has actually taught our kids to be this self-absorbed and narcissistic,'' Piper wrote.

"Any time their feelings are hurt, they are the victims. Anyone who dares challenge them and, thus, makes them 'feel bad' about themselves, is a 'hater,' a 'bigot,' an 'oppressor,' and a 'victimizer.'''


is this fuckiing real
âIn his blog post, Piper describes a student complaining to him that he felt "victimized" by a sermon involving a specific Bible verse because it made him feel bad for not showing love.â
Welp, this is gonna be great
ty babe <3
I'll let you know when I pick up the new monitor on Friday
Tomorrow
So when do you wanna meet up?
Do you want to meet at noon and talk about it over lunch?
Why would you be sad? I browsed longer than I should have the other night, there's some good stuff in there
Mhmmm sure sure
Lol
...Thank you?
I thought that was me?
Really? Did not see that coming
Alex?
I feel like at least half of the peer advising office would be down
Oh, crap, yeah scratch that
Oh, lol good point
Hmm I don't know any hardcore Lil Wayne fans but I'll ask around
Weird, I just saw something about presale being this Thursday
Yeah, looks like it'll range from $30-$80
Hey bud! I put in the order, and the new monitor is supposed to arrive on Friday. Iâll let you know when I pick it up and you can come carry away my current one. Square me at your leisure. (y) <3
Lmao, I'm glad you know me so well. That's gunna be so much fun, I haven't been to a real concert in ages
Wow, that sounds incredible, yeah definitely! Where is it?
In the real I'm broke af
Word.
So I'm just the backup plan?
Here
It's really designed  to take affect after you start working there.
Basically 99% of people are working "at will". You can also leave at any time. 
I think you are going to get some big offers but maybe this guy can offer you a ground floor opportunity if it the company really has potential.
Yeah, stay in touch with him. It's probably only a little more than a year till u start looking for a full time position.
I'm not sure about the tech side is but it looks like citi will pay you $16k more. I would get a big name on your resume  and some money in your pocket for now. If you want to join a start up after graduation id say go for it
Nvm
Mhmmm
Yeah that video makes sense, I was thrown off when you mentioned double linked list
What type of company is it?
I thought it was a stack, basically, that you could take things off the front and back
........wait.......
How are you with deques?
Thank you my good sir
Think it's jasonipp2215
Yeah so we should both definitely go over our lines more before we meet again anyway
Do you think we should just wait until we all meet so we can get feedback on what we're doing so we don't get used to anything? Also, have you gone over your lines yet again...cause I haven't really had time to yet
Thursday between 12 and 2:50
Probably not
Yeah I'd like to meet in person some time
I have class from 4:25-5:50 but that'd it
When do you want to meet up?
Yeah sure
Hey do you think I could get some help with a lab sometime possibly? 
No rush
Thanks!
Wait, can you describe exactly where the cpods are? Just had like 3 questions
Yeah it was there so I was like fuck it
Go apply if you haven't so you don't miss out
I guess all the spots are taken
I'm on the waitlist
I'm on the wait list for MSG too
I guess so
The last day the first day and whichever one is jbb
I wouldn't do more than like a 40lb kettle ball/dumbbell. It's meant to be somewhere between a supplement, warmup, stretch 
I'd be more than happy to sell it for ~$250
Acer B286HK
It's a 28-inch 4K display. Excellent condition (have you fucking met me?), got all the cables. HDMI, DisplayPort, tons of USB3 ports.

YAYAYAY can't wait I'll send out in a little 
Thank u if u don't wanna do it just let me know 
Okay can u send me an abstract again 
Just let me know so I can send an email or we can set it for next week and make it the last one 
Whatever u would like 
Hii do you want to present today 
You're right, porn*
Wow, I'm super jelly. Good motivation though
Some of those butts cannot be real
Damn. That first one..she has nice boobs
I personally like the thread about "weirdest thing that's ever happened to you in bed" or something like that. Too damn funny
Well done
*Slow clap*
Don't they?
Everyone does
ðð¼
At least none I plan on sharing
ð
I don't have any kinks
Hopefully
Lol, a simple man. Well all I can say is don't be afraid to be a little selfish if you want to try something. Sex is a two-way street
Haha I don't really have sexy advice ready to go, but I'll always answer questions
She should compromise for you, too, though. Even if it's not her favorite thing, if you're into it you guys can probably reach a happy medium
Lol no of course not. You guys just like different things then..if it's a huge dealer breaker, then onto the next girl
#communicationissexy
I wanna say sure why not, but also asking as you go is perfectly acceptable. "Do you like your hair pulled?" will clarify everything
True <3
Eh, choking is probably for a smaller crowd, but as far as dominating I'd say yeah
I don't think you've realized it yet, but I'm actually an awful
Person
Lmaooo yeah oops :/ disregard
Rape carefully, and I'll never have to
Your comment about girls leggings providing an extra layer of defense makes more and more sense
orehand. "Consensual forced sex" is a better, less catchy term
Ahh. Well from what I understand it's a popular one. I think the word "rape" makes it sound more taboo than it is - It's not rape if it's agreed upon bef
Not judging, just curious
Haha how did that come up?
Go on...
You right, that's how I got caught last time I guess
I think if you labeled it "not child porn" it would be more accurate
Lol that convo was funny
I'm not clicking that
Dammit, I should have known
Lmao, word of the day
Hahaha, *vagina
Don't tell me what to do with my bagina
Haha, given the right circumstances maybe, but I'm saying there's more to him than a pretty face
Being compared to Dwight is the highlight of my day. I wouldn't say crush, I just like the way he carries himself.
Nah, Creeds aight, but I think best character is a toss up between Jim and Dwight
No...no we don't...
 Hmm, Steve Carell is bae, but maybe I'll pick it up again. I miss Jim and Dwight
Oh, no, I pooped out at the beginning of 8 - is season 9 worth it?
Which episode?
Fuck yeah, the office
Sounds solid, I wish I could get drunk four nights in a row and push all my hangovers to the fifth day
Yeah as long as we know our lines we will be fine
I'm kind of nervous but I think we'll be fine winging it
Yeahh as long as we both know our lines really well it should be fine
Okay thanks. How was your break?
Do you know if ResCon library hours remain the same for next semester?
It may be a little hard. I'm on my way back now, but maybe like 10ish...that's pretty late though?
You texted me after I left and I forgot them
Already did
...those are mine lol
Probably what do they look like
Oh shit, yea they aren't leaving until 5:45. My mom is probably still out
You called
Ok cool thabks man

But that might only be compliance, don't let that stop you.
And that they are slave driving jerks. I knew a couple of people who quit Barclays and they made them stay 6 months just to screw up their new job. Another guy quit citi and when to Barclays for a huge raise and has been beginning to come back ever since. But then again you might get Islander tickets.
Yes based on Barclays and HSBC. Both are British and have that reputation. It only takes 2 to make a stereotype.
Okay lol

Yeah they're ok too. They are bigger than citi since it sold Smith Barney. It looks like the synchrony and citi offers will expire before u get a design from Bloomberg or JPM.
Will do.  Luv u.  Let me know how it goes in Friday
As butch just said...Just as well they suck. Don't worry it will happen for you.   My interview today went well I think. I had 4 different interview with six different people. I won't hear for another couple weeks.

Oooooooooo. How bout 30.
Well you probably spent 60 on it right

I feel retarded, does Cleveland have a b side?
I probably miss drunk dominos the most out of all things American
I'm 63% sure that's a yes. How much do you want for it
That's ok -I'm not impressed with Citi either.
When do u have to let Citi know?
fuck them, just use your entrepreneurial skills and build a bigger financial firm than gold mans
i protect my babies
WHO THE FUCK DOES GOLDMAN SACHS THINK THEY ARE
Iâm so mad now!!!!!!
you need a tub of ice cream and like 5 liters of wine
Haha yes so do I, so the weekend sounds perfect
and you have every right to mope and feel bad for yourself
today is a shitty day
you have every right to be sad
so their fucking loss
so they need people like you who are smart and capable, not the dumbasses that are currently there
and goldman sachs is one of the reasons for the global economic crisis
 boy
You're one of the most driven/passionate people I know and it's insanely inspiring. You make me wanna do great things, so don't fret. You're golden, pony
pportunities and if you so choose I'm sure in the future you could try again and perhaps get it with the extra experience. But seriously, I say ef them. 
You're killing the game on various levels. Goldman Sachs are dummies for turning ya down, they don't know what they're missing. You have a ton of other o
and you are so capable of anything
d youâre one of my best friends for a reason
it just doesnât make sense to me, weâve been friends for so long an
 say things to make you feel better. Iâm not that kind of person
no in all seriousness, you know Iâm not a bullshiter and would just
Of course! <3 Iâm always here to help cheer you up a bit if you need it; hope I can help.
Youâre awesome, and donât forget that.
thats why Iâm so confused
ncanny way of making everyone around you just love you instantly
And C)
 regardless of your skill set, youâre so personable and have this u
B) sorry you had a shitty day that's the worst I had a shitty weekend so we'll have to have a chat soon
like knowing you, i know you wouldâve killed it at your interviews.
Iâm so confused to how you âwerenât good enoughâ
Believe me, Iâve had my fair share of those days. But, youâre a hard worker, you put in the effort, youâre tenacious, and more than most people I know, you donât take ânoâ for an answer. So go put a stick up your professorâs butt and seize the day. :) Erik, youâre a great guy, and you deserve all the best. Maybe itâs just that Goldman Sachs doesnât deserve you. ;) Go find the company that actually makes you happy. :)
airforce*
you literally worked for the airfare
what the fuck Iâm so confused??
What Iâm trying to say is, this doesnât reflect on you at all. There are some days where all the factors are just out of our hands. You gave Goldman Sachs what you could, you put in the effort for acting, and on CS tests, we all fuck up sometimes (me included!). Itâs not easy juggling all these things, and some days, everything feels like itâs just tumbling down on our heads.
Are u going except the offers from Synchrony or Citi or are u waiting to hear back from other places?
These big companies donât care about us, and donât have time to really put in to deciding who they want. To them, weâre first-come-first-serve, and it doesnât really matter how much effort we put in to getting there.
I would.
ation to be as sad as you want
A) yeah other people would kill to be in your position BUT that doesn't take away from the shiftiness of your day so you have a millions percent justific
whats up my love
Well
Your background and interview was probably perfect. Theyare know for  obsessively looking for the elite. It could also be nepotism. You almost have to know somebody to get in that place.
I'm more than happy to listen if ya need
It's okay
Iâm available by text or here in person if you want, whatever you prefer.
But you can be sad to me if you'd like
This is Therese

It also says you'll get a one time $2000 payment for relocation.
It's says you'll get those benefits after 90 days, which you won't be there for- which is ok because you would have to pay for them and you are already covered. I don't see anything about full time.
What do you mean full time? Are they going to wait for you for 2 years?
What time are we leaving for RPI?

We're at zona now 
Lol no it's because this has happened to me too many times to count
Yeah. Is it with the same guy that has the py game problems?

It's because YouCompleteMe is linked against the system Python instead of the Homebrew ones. He needs to brew unlink python python3, if I'm not mistaken.
It's supposed to rain down here Tuesday. Bring some rain gear if u have it.
Try not to use free wi fi like Starbucks because you can be hacked. I guess you know that already.
When I was interviewing I would have to go to the library or call the company for an annual report.
Go to a finicial website- even yahoo finance and type in GS and just read the recent headlines about the company.
Maybe and not summer interns but don't be surprised if they do.
:)
Yes, they are also known for making their employees work long late hours.
Okay, see you at the Lecture Halls, then.
There was an article on the internet today that they are promoting their young staff within 2 years so they won't lose them.
I'll start walking down in 5 minutes.

I got out of class a little while ago; had to go up to Hillside to drop off my stuff and grab some food before 101. But I'm going to head down soon. Where are you?

Absolutely ðð¼
What's your proposition?
At least I kept min fair
This is why I say don't trade him,  he makes bs  trades
Every one is fine but Francesco
Don't trade with Francesco lol make him give up a lot
Nice working with you, this remains between us
I'm not sure,  I think we can work something out closer to then
A spot in the finals
If he does well you get desert
I can do this when ever
Then no desert
Desert based on how my team finished
And garlic bread
Ingram and chicken parm
Cj2k or Bernard and tevon Austin
No Charles is out and I only need a rb
He's the main guy I want
Like who
 Denver d or kicker
ð
I Can make garlic bread as a side,  anything more and you'll have to throw in another player
What recruiting event were you at?
I just saw your snap...ð
Chicken parm with home made sauce
I can buy you alcohol or cook you dinner
Name some choices
What do you want
It did,  im also willing to throw cj2k instead of Bernard
Did you get my trade proposal
Yo
Thanks for the sheer and I forgot my bag with some clothes in it
Yeah I read that on the letter. It takes time to check in as a guest and find your way to where u need to be. I guess they wanted  you. ready to go at 9 on the dot.
There are sometimes complete disaster days on the trains. We can take the 6:30 instead to make sure you aren't late.
Yes, we get to penn about 7:45 and jersey about 8:20. Your best bet is to pick up the Wtc train one stop to exchange place. If everything goes right you  will get there 8:40.
The same one we took last time, the 6:59 to penn and then the path to Newport.
That's dope
What does that mean?
Jersey city has all the financial companies lined up along the water like a board walk. I'm at the north end and Gs is at the south end.
It's a subway stop away. About 20-30 min walk.
Nice- I see the Goldman Sachs building everyday from my desk from my desk when I look out the window.

Good luck at your interview if it hadn't already happened
I imagine their housing is close. Don't forget if you are in the City it's going to cost you about $400 a month and about 1.5 hrs each way( unless they have housing)
They have almost 50% of the store credit cards. They used to be GE capital. GE spun it off last year. But Ge still owns about 85 % of the stock. Mkt cap is about $25 billion. They aren't little nobodies.
I do what I can

I really like this is our youth!
In our classroom?
I'm here
U there?
Hey just left the building be there in a few min 
How did you get the spot? Apply online?
What would I get if I did it this summer?
Okay, yeah I guess I'll try for it. Did you get paid?
So me doing it this summer would be not smart
And you still felt that it was really hard
Damn what year did you do it?
How did you like it and what exactly did you do there? I'm thinking about it
Lmaoo
Thanks for the link bro...I texted jus in case u forgot u had my number haha
Ok
Hey Eric, did you do research at the Rome lab ?
When are you leaving on Thursday?
Did u get the tickets?
Do you think you can send me the pdf of that play?
Probably taking design patterns with you since there's a conflict with security
Yeah, basically. Also be cool with the risks of puke and teeth, lol
Higher probability of teeth getting in the way, too
 too deep and make her puke, if she can't deepthroat or isn't prepared that's only natural
It depends on the girl, like usual. She might be into that, but you gotta be sure before you try that on someone. There's also a good chance you might go
That sounds like a personal problem
You literally told me it was time sensitive and to not bother now
I didn't get any loving this morning either, we'll be okay ðð¼
Lol we got this 
Fuck
Oh okay fine 
Are they free earlier?
Did she ever email u when she's free?
If u want to practice earlier 
My last class just got cancelled 
Hey
Why? Were you with someone this morning?
He also lives in UP, it's down the block, yeesh
I just still don't understand why it's so hard to find time to hang out lol 
Ya...
I guess the only thing left is to see what happens 
But ya it does seem to be one of his only moves so far haha 
Lol. You're the best Erik :) 
Idk. I guess let him make the move 
Hahaha ok 
Haha ok ok so let's go back 
Haha well I could do both actually I just moved from my comp to my phone 
Ok awesome
Ohhh then I may have it. I look at it when I get back
Is that on our reading list?
Yeah agreed. Definitely love proof though. I'd be fine with any play except for Middle Ages we just need to find a good scene
Hey so we have to have our scene for tomorrow. I really liked spike heels but I looked through and I don't really think there is a scene that would be good to do. Idk though
Hey I'm sorry I'll be in rehearsal then

Drop bodyfat percentage, you have to be very lean before you see ab definition
 have to drop your body fat though, I don't think I'd like the overall result
Nah, I kind of want to achieve that look at some point, like I understand the diet requirements and what you have to do ...I'm not wild about how low you

Hey what's your mom's home address in florida? I want to send her a Halloween card. 
Lmaoooo if you even considered that for a second I'm flattered
 I can dead lift 250, calm down
How much you squatting?
I mean if you like the look im sure she can work something out. Try jeggings
"A quick google search" ---> your browsing history.
Much better
Nope don't do that lol. 1.) 99% chance they won't fit right 2.) she's not gunna be bad in jeans, she won't be able to move well in them
But you can't buy jeans for a girl, she has to try them on and everything...
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not, lol
ry about that stuff, ya'll lucky
Haha, I think that's true for all girls. We all have different hips, butt, and thigh sizes, it's hard to find jeans that work. You guys don't have to wor
It's very hard to find jeans that fit...
Yeah I think I saw her outside out of EB on a picnic blanket crying forever

Thanks for supporting Women in Computing
Hellooooo
Amen 
Can't build a big dick but you can build a kingdom and giant muscles
And you're kidding yourself if you think otherwise of yourself
Everything I do is to compensate for the size of my penis
I'm out there putting my life on the line and the haters only care about the size of my dick
Haha
Idk if you know what a front squat looks like but it's awkward as fuck and not optimal bar throwing position
I failed on my last two of the last set and started falling backwards and just launched the bar as hard as I could into the rack
Yes
Last week I almost got stapled to the ground during a front squat so you may be in for a treat
And I'll tell you whether or not I think ou should go up
I'll watch you squat 
I'll watch you squat 
Sure 10
I'm front squatting tomorrow. We can squat together
What time are you going
Form is your main priority right now
 Leg press does not equal squat
I drank like 6 liters of water too
iâm the only guy. the opposite of what annika was worried about
women in computing?
Haha okay sounds good 
All good no worries 
R u in room yet 
Hi 
bad news.. looks like also is a pre-req for DP

Worries* catch ya later
No worried. Understood. Just checking in. 
Sorry
In the elevator
Hey did you get my email? What did you end up deciding?
Yeah, I didn't mean drive home from work. That sounds good. All the games start at 8 so if you left post at 5 it would give u plenty of time even if u have to park far away.
Or I guess you can come home and then take the train back to Citifield.
It up to you. I guess you can drive home and then drive to the game. 4 hours is a long time to wait around. Parking will be a disaster but if you leave early enough you can park near where mike used to live.
When is the citi interview over? I don't get out till 5. Are u going to stay in the city and wait for me and then we can take the train to Citifield?
thanks I try to be as cool as possible!!
that would be awesome thanks so much! and nah I get it it's all good :)
butttt to make up for it... where are you going for Christmas? your mom or your dads? cuz if your dads, I was wondering if you'd be able to take a bag down for me cuz I can't take a lot on the bus
it's ok! I'll take escape
Financial firms are alittle more formal. Is probably a good sign they are asking you for this stuff.
Wow that would be nice. I'll let you   know my hours . Get back to you on how to get in house.  
Okay cool thank u I just liked what you wanted to talk about 
Only if u want to no pressure 
Thanksgiving* 
Hey so would you like to do ur presentation the week after hank shoving ? 
I'm so sorry
what was that grape liquor you got for Jess's bday
hey cool kid
I'll probably wait until after next week now
Yeah I plan on applying to drop box I just haven't written a cover letter yet
I agree. I just want hope that people are doing cool shit
I don't see any internships though
Tell her I said wow back
How come no one informed me earlier?
I just got back
I did
Ight sounds good
Doesn't really matter
I mean c4 is the closest to me but where ever u want  is fine 
330 works for me 
Tom when u free?
Thankss
I guess lol 
And for the oral presentation are we just talking about the topic or do we have to relate it too put person?
Okay fine I'm good with that

Did we have to write something for the play 
Hahahah
The girl kept burping 
Lol he did eat a lot the other guy was funny 
I really liked it

Oh no, Erik... ð
Which one, the new Fassbender one, or the Ashton Kutcher one???

Lol 
Meh, I was pissed going to bed so late because I had to get up early, but otherwise it was aight. Did you go out after John?
Lol u guess all I need to do is pretend I'm a lion lol whatever that means 
Lol, as do I <3
I'm fucked. 
UK were doing our actual full scene wed 
Ha!!!!  Good look
to his house at 4am, no shirt...at that point I went to sleep since he was safe, lol I'm sure there's more to his adventure but I haven't heard yet
e can find Zach. Searched everywhere. Called him but he was too drunk to be helpful. Drove up and down the streets looking for him. He finally gets back 
Haha, basically we were at Jahreals house and Zach wasn't feeling well so we were going to walk him home. We get our stuff ready to head out...then no on
Okayy good now I'm pumped lol 
Yeah it's good?
And Bryan's with us now
We didn't see it yet
U see it yet?
We're at the play 
Lol it was Moriah 
Where?
Perhaps we can do dinner ?
I shall
Lol my family is gone actually but I need to have solitary work time today because of the magnitude of things I need to accomplish
Yes, Erik?
I'm glad he was funny tho! I've heard good things
Sorry, tonight was a shitshow. We lost Zach, he ran off drunk and we don't know where he is...
I am not ð¬ I'm guessing you went, how was it?
Female comedians <<<
Lelelel 
It's hard to explain, it's just kind of a gut thing
 ð¬ maybe we could dinner Tuesday?
Lol Im afraid I can't, I have to shower then do 240 with some peeps
Merp I'm sorry! I ate around 9, I'm just headed out for a run :/
Ok . I'm gonna let you cover the security deposit because you will get that back. I'll  send u a check the  for about $3600.
Ok I'll mail you a check tomorrow.  . It should be 2k plus $1300 for 2 months = $3300. I would imagine there are extra fees and charges associated with the tickets.
Sorry, I was at Jenn's, working. Late, probably useless response right now. What's up?
Ok good. Did you close the deal on your new apartment?
Ok the tickets are being emailed to my yahoo email?
Yes-do it.
Either way I'm walking to my car in AA now just walked out of engineering building
It's says there is only one ticket. The one below it says 2 at $1000 each.
Want a ride or nah
Ya
Murph, Matz, Niese and clipard are all at the Islander game tonight.
Just finished
Yes , try to double check where they are first. 
My friend at work said there are field level seats for about $1000 each on stu b hub. If you could find field level seats for about $1000 each would do it.
Oh damn. I'll do some research
Nerdddd
Meh, I'm tired
Yeah, I was trying to imply you gave her an std but my phrasing was off
Yeah, she said it'll clear up in two to three weeks, no worries
Ah gotcha, and yep! Should be interesting next year
Also whos Alexis? Or did you mean Alex?
I'll be signing my lease then, thanks for the offer tho!
MERP kinda poopy but I think I'll be okay. Any fun plans for the weekend?
yeahhhhhhh buddyyyy
To my death
I know. I'm sorry for being a party pooper. I thought you might know someone  else that would want to go.
I don't think I'm going to go. If you want to go I'll buy you a ticket.
I like that phrase
Yes.
This weekend I am pretty booked up due to madre visiting and immense amounts of work but Sunday may work
 I am library-ing tonight
Lol probably not nah
Sure, Iâd be happy to.
I don't know. I'll think about it. 
good! 
so jewish
where are you sitting?
ok leaving the union now
Ok, great! That should work well. Let me know if you have any questions.
Does Ryan know to come here?
I'm in my room. I'll come down we just need to find an empty room 
Rafuse
Sounds good 
Where are the $ 740 seats?
 Not sure how else to get them besides online. Do you want to check and see what the prices are like?
If you really want to go can you get the 2 tickets and I'll send you a check? Let me know what the prices are like.
I got the link but I'm debating it.
You handled it beautifully 
Das cool
Ps - the isles dominated the last 4 teams they played. They beat the Blue jackets so bad they fired their coach and hired Tortarella---he's back.
I know! All spambots though
I know, I hate it. If you're going to spend time trolling me, why bother RT'ing Jaden? Ugh, disrespect
Lol fuck no
Look up this profile when you get to your computer.
It's so fucking weird.
http://twitter.com/dankkush_69/status/656506172338475008
awfully suspicious i think
Tell me that doesn't sound like you...
There's a Twitter account (@dankkush_69) that tweets at me and only at me, and it seemed awfully like it could have been you...
Excuses...
I'm on to you, you fucker
*crickets*
Or rather, @dankkush_69
OH!!!!!! I just remembered.
Does, erm, dankkush_69 mean anything to you?
erikmingle.com could work

Or minglewitherik.com -- more to the point
Itai: Erik, I've always hated that saying of yours, but this time I'll let it slide. ;)

Also, you did create kittenmingle.com for a reason ;)))))
Itai: BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ð
Jenn: Lol. Back off bitch he's mine.
Itai says you're just being a Chris. 
Jenn: since she hasn't texted you she's probably just trying to be friendly. She doesn't want it to be awkward. Let it go. There are other girls out there who won't be too wussy to tell you what they want. Either way the ball is in her court. 

Itai also asks for how long you'd been texting, and how long it's been since he hasn't texted you.
I would take it as her being friendly, but I wouldn't reach out to her again
ðð¼
350, 373, 375 and maybe dumb prob stats
Damn, I'll pray for you ððð
I have a 240 project and lab, and a 320 project to get done...taking three CS classes next year might be questionable. What are you taking?
Meh, just a lot of work. Schools poopy
It*?
Haha, a little grumpy. And mhmmm, are you gunna do I tv
Wish I could say the same
Smile if you make awkward eye contact for some reason, but otherwise I wouldn't really do anything
nope, do not approach.
Bump girl who didn't reply?
Why are you angsty?
Are you wondering what to do?
You would be the main attraction. :)
Lol, I'm just joking around. You're a good kid, Erik, and I like you. :) <3 Follow your heart!
On a scale from one to a dozen, you're still both a bit ridiculous...
You and Chris are both ridiculous people
Omg, Erik, just pick, lol
You know that just saying hi to someone is normal, yes?
Yikes, lol
Well, go say hi
Worth saying hello for what end? If you want to say hi, say hi, if not, don't. :P
If she doesn't remember you, say that you're one of my friends and never mind. She'll understand...
Okay, thanks Erik
I'm also not making hackBU tomorrow :/
Fun fact: this is the highest fever I've ever had ððð¼
They don't test for the flu but they said its "most likely" that, soo I'm on antibiotics

Awe yeah
's affected her. Maybe she hasn't had time to process that (not defending her actions, just saying)...when did she start talking to Jack? Also do you kno
Hmmmm, yeah I won't say anything, obviously. Strange. I believe she got out of a serious relationship about a month and a half ago, I'm not sure how that
Not per se. Implied 
Essentially yes. She was talking about how her values changed and her ex boyfriend 
Huh?
Can I ask how she was mean? That really doesn't sound like her at all...neither does the slut comment, I always got a conservative vibe from her
Like 99% sure you're joking
e than the other girls, so far, she's cool

Hey Eric it's Mariah. I feel really bad about this but I had kinda been planning to ask Alison to be my partner and she asked me after class and I realized I really wanted to partner with her. Would you mind if I partnered with her instead? I'm sorry I said yes in class I should have thought about it more before I responded. It's nothing personal, you're great and we would be good together but me and Alison, had both been kinda hoping to partner up?  Its not that I don't want to work with you, I just also really want the opportunity to do a girl scene.

I think they just _had_ to be there, and weren't terribly enthused about it.

I had time left over with the second of the two guys, so I asked him what fun problem he had recently gotten to work on. He looked totally dumbfounded, as if you could even enjoy your job. I refined it to say "interesting" so he though for a while and came up with "well, it was interesting, but I wouldn't call it fun..." ð Dude, fucking quit your job.

Wow that's a lot. Seems like some general info in addition to programs...
Ok let me take a look
Hey man I can answer it now if you're available.
Fine
I feel like that's safe
You can check out what we have available on our website. There are a couple of options :)
Tell her about the amount of ass you want to crush per week in kilograms
If you have a specific goal you want to hit (like doing a certain number of pull-ups or squatting a certain amount of weight) I would suggest custom.
What is the other basic program
Did you ask what she would recommend
It is when the are playing the Mets in the playoffs.
There are a few options: 1) run through the same program with heavier weights, 2) start on the other basic program, 3) start on a custom program.
Happy Dodger elimination day.

Jenn and I were on our way to Nezuntoes and I was going to say that it might be awkward if Chris gave me the stink eye. But I assumed you returned it.

Also, sorry for not hanging out last night. Jenn and I were watching the final two episodes of How I Met Your Mother and the buildup was intense. :P
Hey, BTW, did you get a chance to return the stuff to Nezuntoes yesterday?
Too bad. Is was looking forward to some pay back on Chase but the Dodgers will be eliminated by then. The announcers except for Ron said it was a clean slide.

Hey meeting at 2?
What?
And yeah I do
Yeah we made it back safe
Hahaha
What's up chief
Even if you are on automatic pay they still send a bill . Your automatic pay could be ok. 
If u are on automatic pay they will probably take it automatically.
Erik u got a bill from NYSEG for $295.75. . $80 is for your monthly bill and $215.75 is for a security deposit. They say if u don't pay they will charge late fees. Are u on automatic payment?
It think they were saying Utley ran off the field because he was mistakenly called out. Even if they called Utley out the game would have been tied and Agons double would have put them ahead. It really didn't matter that much except that Tejada is hurt and Utley is a jerk.
Technically u have to touch it but the umps allow the neighborhood play so infielders don't get demolished like last night.
I hope he is concussed and has headaches the rest of his life. How could they over turn that out call? The replay wasn't conclusive.
We are leaving ahora

True wanna just go from there and get a ride/cab/bus downtown
Hell yeah
What the balls

Oh, I can pass it as a parameter
Wait no, that's wrong too
Mhmm. Maybe I should just declare it in Bank.cpp, I think I answered my own question
Is there any way I can make Bank.cpp see the bank object declared in main?
I think it would be a lot of fun
Btw you wanna go to that party in hillside tonight it's the same people as that other time we went
Then going to g7 for 350

Hi- random. I'm in a class that I have to go to 10 engineering, bio or life science seminars and only 8 of them can be at cornell, so I'm looking for ones at Bing. I tried to navigate the website but can't find anything. Do you know where I can find a listing/know who I can email for a listing/know of any bio or BME profs that would be nice to me if I emailed them asking about this? I asked caro and she had no idea hahah I figured since you're in engineering you may know better
ha. Good luck.  Wish us luck too, taking out buyers and the probability of them buying something is against all stats

Maybe what?

Merp
Ask before you choke her...
Oh? Lol, well have fun
I've heard asphyxiation can heighten orgasm, too
an expression of that
I'd say there's an 8/10 chance any girl you end up with is going to prefer to be dominated. To what degree varies, it's kind of a spectrum, but chokings 
Wait, choking like during a BJ, or with the guys hands?
LMAO, why is that worthy of being a story? That poor girl, smh. It's more common than you would think
 to have anal done, at least you can orgasm from that
I guess some girls do feel some stimulation with that, but I think general rule of thumb is its not our go-to. It genuinely makes more sense for you guys
Mmmm, I'll think about it
No Erik, I will not peg you
I'm always here for you
I'm glad I could be that milestone in your life
Sorry, I don't do nudes

I will be using it to mess with itai
Over the weekend i procured @dankkush_69

I vote for âCoputer Upgradetionâ to be the new name of our hackathon
Dope
I'm still in G7, I'll just meet you from there
Isadora had a cold too. How are your classes? How's the apartment?
How is everything going?
We've all been getting new cards. It the new microchip technology. They are replacing all the old cards.
You got a new debit card from MT. I'm mailing to 86 oak st, bing ny 13905, basement apt. Is that right?
Meh, we'll talk about it
Just don't get me sick, I will kill you
That would be lovely :)
Maybe cold stone at 9?
Ughhh, you're literally making me so fat. I think I'll be okay with 240, it's just expanding the bank account thing from last lab
Aiden Cullo 
And I would but I stuffed myself about an hour ago, plus I'm tryna get 240 done tonight :/
 Meh, I'd give it like a 6.5/10
Do you write at all?
Some girl in my creative writing class wrote an "Ode to my Bed" poem
Jk, I agree. I don't like things like that. If you can do it you can do it, if you can't you can't
Like you said, it's hard to be a white, middle-class, heterosexual male
Discrimination 
That's honestly discern
Lmfaoo
This is the world today
Merp ð
I feel that, I just added some spices to my pasta sauce and its now on point
Mhmm okay, Zach made a comment once and I couldnt tell if he was serious or not
Question: at any point in time did you think I was goth?
Lol it's okay, I wore all black and feel weird cuz it's a sunny, perky day out
Your verbs are confusing me, you did what?
And yeah, I'd judge someone ordering chicken soup in a heartbeat
Weird places? Go on..
But seriously, I'm sorry your sick :( cold? Fever? Aids?
, you should know better than that
Wow, you're a terrible student. Missing class because you're sick? Emailing professors ahead of time and letting them know? I can't believe you right now
Hey what's up hello

Oh lololololololololololol thatâs pretty good
If this was a joke, I didnât really get it, lol

Indeed.
I will go anywhere your heart desires

We shall arrange this
We gotta get together for a meal soon

Thanks kid, also are you dressed like a mathlete or nah
So if I need to hit a bitch tonight, back me up. Kaitlyn has been cat called twice already and I'm fuming on the inside
Sounds like it could be funny
What lmfao
You going out tn?
Ok, we'll be at sig nu @10:30. Math up bro, I'm coming for you
Where on campus
Sweet!
So how's the ride
Lol we'll make it an adventure.

8th grade pant dropper playlist all night
Oksounds good
What's your eta
ðð¼ðð¼
Picking up food in a sec

Where u at? / where should we go?
Heading out now, be there in ~15 minutes
Jenn is finishing packing up but the food is ready at Thai Time so as soon as she's ready we'll go and I'll let you know.
Sure, weâre just getting ready to leave my apartment for Jennâs now. If you come to the loading zone (right by the hillside bus stop) we can take your stuff.
Your total comes out to $15 (including tax)
Sounds good, thatâs what I thought.
So does that imply that you want it not spicy, or that Iâm wrong and you want it spicy? #ambiguity
You want your Drunken Noodle not spicy, right?
Sure. Iâm putting in the order right now so that would work out perfectly. Weâll come to you when the food is ready and pack in the meantime. (y)
#swert
And we have a more relaxed time constraint than I thought so itâs okay.
Looks like Thai Time is closed until 4:30, so just come up here when youâre done. Weâll order when we can. :)
You're too kind
Ill assume I looked fabulous as always
Excellent, looking forward to it
Sounds good. Weâre planning on putting in the Thai Time order at around 4:00 so weâll be picking it up at around that time. Feel free to take your time or head to my apartment. People should be here.
Sounds good. When are you scheduled to be done?
NVM found the correct site
lel

Also, can you send me a link to your assignment PDF? Itâs not on Bartensteinâs siteâ¦
Np
Can do. ðð
If we order from Thai Time, what would you like?
Lol it's okay thanks anyway homie 
I need one for a mixer lol
Omg so sad ð­ð­
Do you happen to have an extra necktie that you won't be wearing to date party?
When do you leave for geneseo
Yo
ððð
See you there chief.
It's calling your name lol, I have to go shopping now
Oh gotcha, thanks for the clarification.
Lol no idea what that means but bring home the gold
*mathletes
Theme tonight is math lets vs athletes, this is all you kid
I SEE YOU
ððð¼ð
Okay, we'll be there real soon.
Maybe there are seats out by the CCPD area?
Just grabbed food to go at Nezuntoes and got in the car. We'll be there in ~10 minutes.

Grab a seat somewhere if you can?
ðð¼ððð¼
Sound okay?
Okay, so the plan right now is: we're going to go get food and bring it to the BUMP. We'll eat there and I'll help you with 220. Realistically we'll likely get there at around 12:40 or so, but that should leave us with a solid amount of time to cover 220.
Jamz the Boner
Np 

Jenn gets out of class at 10:40 and she's going to come back here. I'll talk to her â she's also got class at 1:10, so maybe we'll come down to the Marketplace to eat/work at around noon. I'll let you know.
Okay, sure thing! When do you have class, BTW?
I'm going to go down to campus to return a text book probably at around noon. You going to be around?
. So yea just come thru but I will be sexiling you at some point
Kaitlyn send Jenn an her friend are going to be going to the frat as well before the bar because that's what most people do. They go to the bars at 12ish
she's doing a lot of work but I'll get back to you ASAP
I mean, I won't because I'm with Kaitlyn. It's like an unwritten rule they must accept me or I'll beat a bitch. Kaitlyn has yet to respond to me because 
I know that phi lamb is going to a party at a frat on Friday night and I go wherever Kaitlyn goes. Let me get the details
azer. Should I man up and do the pants as well?
Lol atta boy, I'm still in a tshirt and shorts. I feel awful though. And that's nice I like it. Saturday I'm going khakis dress shirt and tie and grey bl

Thanks Erik, are you coming to the acm competition tonight?
Okay I'm registered
Walking to c4 now
I mean, I donât mind if you come by after, unless itâs really inconvenient for you.
Is it something you need me for physically, or can you quickly take a screenshot/send me code?
After, then? I'll be around...
I'm not coming tonight; they're apparently using HackerRank and I don't have time for their bullshit. What are you doing before that, though? I'll be either at Jenn's or here in my room.
I'm sure you all would have a blast.  
We talked to Alex last night and he said he would definitely be up for that if the timing is right for u...ROAD TRIP
Yes.  If you could do the same would you be willing to drive down with them and the dog. 
Can u call me tonight to discuss I looked at flights earlier in the week and there wasn't that many seats left.  Julia n Alex are looking to come down the Sunday before to the sun after
Hey did u find anything out about Xmas

Hey is there room on the bus for hackRU
Was a good*
Actually don't, lol but that was a comeback, you get an A-
Go on...
Way to go
It got cancelled out. You started with an insult, so naturally I was crying too hard to care about the rest
It was a joke, playing off of you saying you weren't sure if my face was pretty
No, moments gone
Nvm, no one gets me
I'd reply, but I'm too busy looking for a bag to put over my head
Like a thousand times better
You "think" I'm pretty? You're not sure? Fuck off
Lol, well let me know how it goes
"Let's go on a date" will be better received, it can't hurt to try
Oh, no it was a question, I was asking which one you were going for
Like "Let's bang," or "let's go on a date?"
Yeah, I've read that. Good luck finding a girl willing to be that direct, lol
That's what Reddit said too, just be confident and actually try lol
Jesus Erik
Most things do
It all comes back to sex
she grinds well, I bet she'd be great in bed," and we want to be wanted, so if we can excite you then...yeah
I personally would be self conscious doing that for real in public, but I think girls genuinely like to. I think it subconsciously tells the guy, "Damn, 
The Internet is funny
Lmao no, it just cracked me up
Agreed.
Granted a rager would've been great
Lol
:) 
But it was still fun. I enjoy chill nights like that
Eh yeah and it was kinda last minute too

Sometimes brown rice and often Kale or 'leafy greens' mix
Last night was fun btw thanks :D

Are you really insulted ?- Jenn

The whole situation with Joe Biden sort of evidence of that. Like, why couldn't they iron out whether he was gonna run against Hillary or not? Couldn't you just pull the squad in the oval office and iron it out super quick? All these people are running their own game

OMG you're really doing it lol 
Mhmm, I've always wanted to dive but I'm such a wimp

Honesty my nigga 
Of course I would tell you
Isn't the afterburn wonderful? Workout highs ftw. What did you do exactly?

Hate that bitch in the middle doe 
Oh word idk her 
Absolutely, you didn't know that? You just have to think about it really hard. Only works in the first trimester, though
Show me her 
Oh boy 
Yeah, I guess I'd be okay with that. Good thing I'm a woman and I can control that sort of thing, though
Do you want two girls? If you got to choose?
Naturally. I have no objections

Ok try to find out the contact for citi recruiting from those guys. I had a very hard time trying to find out who to contact for you last year.In a company as big as citi I'm just a random guy too.
Sure. Give me call when you are free. Let me know how it went 
Ok, don't you give them your resume at the job fair?
Ya :( I think I have a stomach virus

Also, if you wanna cover my help desk hours again, that would be awesome. I'm in the car back to bing now and I'm probably not going to be back in time

Hey 
Great circlejerk headline this morning https://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/3l3wrk/til_john_cena_saw_bernie_sanders_last_match_at/
Best post ever
Gotcha
Oh ok. I thought maybe you'd be like NAH BERNIE 420 NOSCOPE 4 LYFE
Hillary haha
Do you like Clinton 
I think they call that "69"
Yes for surely
But yeah, basically. I'll practice at the job fair and see what happens
I'm a biter...just saying
On the bright side - I've learned I should tell everyone I meet that I have AIDS upfront, so this kind of thing never happens again
Damn, we suck
As long as you don't mind AIDS, I'm down ;)
It just always makes me laugh - But I understand, save your material
Without the Reddit background, how would you react if a girl said that to you during?
My favorite line in the whole world â¤ï¸

I don't think we're at that level...

I didn't mention your name but she said she's definitely not looking to date rn
So I talked to Claire and its a no go.
Itâs generally been a few days from my experience. But next time you use Venmo take a look and see if the moneyâs transferred immediately.
Still a hassle that they hold on to your money for a few days. With Square Cash you get the money instantly.
(Just looked it up.)
I remember reading that somewhere but I appear to be wrong. They donât make any money off inter-personal transfers like that, just business ones.
Looking at devpressed.com lol
Nope

I went for some medical testing on Friday and they had to shave some of my chest hair; that pic is what I looked like, and I decided to shave the rest of it off. Better to look like a baby than a freak.
Wow that took a lot of convincing 
Yea you're not allowed to dd
Word up
But I see tom and Marty's in the future 
Not sure
You down to clown?
Yo nigger
Lol I had to shave it all off. I look like a fat baby now.
Yeah, later Jenn and I plan on baking some pies and we want to bring him some.
With him, I mean.
Yeah, outwardly he seems okay, but he's probably not feeling great on the inside. You should swing by later when you can and we'll hang out.
Yeah. How'd you find out? If he didn't tell you directly I don't know how much he'd be okay with me saying.
You have to bend your te if you want the gronk points

Their accents and how they talk make me swoon
I miss America too baby

Just checking

Jenn asks where Kaitlyn Davis lives
We're probably going to stay with a friend of Jenn's (on Main St.); does he need a place to stay or is he asking because he wants to know where we'll be?

What?! Bullshit, you can sexually harass someone before they have a chance to say stop
I'm forwarding this to Rick and filing a harassment complaint
That wasn't an option I offered
I'm tired, accept my tired jokes or gtfo
I'm a solid state drive

Thanks for stopping by though
Oh. Lol, awkward...She said she'd taken it to the Apple Store a few times and they were able to help her, I figured I just didn't know what I was doing.
Lol that's a better analogy. What time do you think you'll get here tomorrow??
How was yours? Did things with that girls computer turn out okay?
Meh, it was okay. We just got back from Walmart, I haven't done my creative writing, I need to be up at 6...meh
ears with her track record
Left as in to go to his school but still boyfriend and girlfriend. Lol maybe, she's just going for numbers now. That vagina probably looks like elephant 
so I don't know what she's doing
Exactly that, she has this boyfriend who she brought to a party and we dislike him very much. When he left, the next week my housemate almost fucked her 
d Kat is having a party on Saturday but she's been irking me lately
So Harry's party is tomorrow night and so is pats, so maybe we could pregame at pats and then go to campus and party. No formal though it's still tbd. An
My friend pat is throwing a party down the block tomorrow and he's psyched that you're coming up
Sweet! Hold on let me ask Harry.
And they are covered with Japanese characters which is the real kicker hahaha

Wanna get app nowl with nick and I?
Nah I was just wondering
Are you on campus ?
And I never know what the fuck he's saying so
I've never seen any of them and my professor keeps making references to them my dinosaur class 
Preferably the last one
Any of the Jurassic park movies 
Still slightly sick and the thought of going downtown isn't exactly appealing
Not for me mi amigo.
Wanna get food?
Ok I think I'm here
Aww. Well, show me after the GIM then?
Hillside
Wanna come hang out until the GIM?
Where are you rn?
Okkk

wow, they are starting early.
Is the one inWisconsin? Is that for next summer?
Without me having to download it 
Could you find me a movie online 
Wait I got it!
Hey Erik I can't get the incidents that I've closed
Thank you Erik
hink it made much of an impact. She has a lot of space on her hard drive left, I didn't see much that would have been affecting her RAM...idk :/
 fixing her TV. Her Macs like 5 years old, 2 GBs of RAM, she gets the spinning beach ball all the time. I force quit applications last time but I don't t
Her email is bjones10@bing, she's really chill. I tried to look at her Mac again but it was so slow I could hardly click around, so I spent the last hour
Can I just tell her in person, since I'm here? Or do you want it in writing?
I'll be in practice then, but she said she's free - would you mind dropping by?
I'm there now, are you free? Hughes 324 B side
Nope, no clue
Can rescons help someone install more ram on their Mac? Or is that considered hardware related?
can I pull up passed tickets for their incident number?
Okay just got out doing it now
Okay thanks Erik, I'm sorry I've just been so overwhelmed with everything that's going on right now. I'm speaking with Eileen, I'll fix it right after
But, fingers crossed! :) You could also probably contact Davix and see if heâd pass your resume along too.
Unfortunately not. Apple tends to keep radio silence about that stuff. :(
I believe that
Lol. Well, theyâll get a choice for what they want to apply to, soâ¦ :P
About that, donât remember off the top of my head. Why?
Yeah, thatâd be a good idea. What do you think we should communicate? We can probably get the list from Leon. Now I remembered what I wanted to ask him and Chris made me forget. :P We should get a list of those students to send them a short email to make sure they know where to go + give our contact info.
HackRU sounds good. Iâll put that in there tentatively, with âmore TBAâ. Anything else you think I should include? :)
What else were we thinking of? (Tentatively?)
BigRed//Hacks is going on the list, as is HackRPI.
No, I meant for Chris & Jack, and Lucas, about the app demos. If theyâre still interested in presenting I want them to let me know. But Iâll include stuff about hackathons, donât worry.
Huhhhhughughh
Talking about working out makes me soft
And weak
More dirty
Are you out?
Ohhhh I want more of that
Wow that was aggressive
Don't piss on my back and tell me it's raining

Joe still being a dick and only going to the venue?

So how's state street? Everyone shut down besides the rat?
I was playing with the auto suggestions, and they made a pretty competent sentence
Ok so I don't think that it was not immediately clear if you want to go back in the first place for a while ago 
The Binghamton experience getting any sweeter?

I was really doing well and happy this last month of summer. And now I'm back and I feel like I've regressed to the first month after the break up and it sucks shit 
Thanks :( 
Sorry  if there were too many he's and hims in that paragraph to differentiate 
/in Hayes 
I'm home 
Because he asked me how things were going so I told him, and he thought I was being ridiculous about the clothes thing and then I mentioned that I saw him talking and laughing to some blonde chick and then he started on saying that I'm upset that he's moved on and I haven't 
E
Surrrrrrrrr
And Fred was trying to convince me earlier that Diddy didn't have a hard time with the break up and that's the real reason I'm upset 
Saw him again at the chabad bbq. Total ignorage on both our ends. I'm in a super shitty mood 
D: 
Slack working now?
Where abouts are you
Mkay leaving the lib now
Also, about your resume, howâd you export it to PDF? Your bullet points are enormous and I want to help fix that before I send it along.
Any specific focus in Software Engineering? Like, do you want to do systems programming, work in frameworks, work on Apple OS X apps (I doubt youâd know them, though)â¦ Knowing what youâre interested in would really help move your resume along. Do you have a specific position in mind?
I can do 515?
So Ruth has a game that Friday afternoon... If I don't pick her up, she won't be able to make it cuz of Shabbat. So I need to go get her. And I'm gonna meet you guys there. 
So I'm not driving with you... 
What's the address of our hotel  
It makes me mad to look at him 
Today he was wearing nicely fitted grey khakis. Tighter pants suddenly don't bother him anymore. Ok 
I just ran into Diddy 
Sure! If you send me your resume I can forward it to my recruiter. What kind of job are you looking to apply for?
Right now I'm doing the ridiculous amount of work I already have ð­

:(
nope we never had problems setting up the modem.  are you sure your house is wired up
Time warner is the only service around
Hi Erik

Ooh okay. It's fine I thought you were off campus. I'll take the bus :) 
Hi, when are you heading to campus?

Didn't get to look yet
Mac tickets are available now 
I is good Erik 
Hi Erik!
Sure thing. Have a nice night.
Ok, I have you down for 2pm this Friday, the 28th. Since it's an intro session as a new member it's just $25. Plan on it taking about 75 minutes :) 
Sorry about taking so long to reply. How about Friday afternoon any time 2-5?
Okay thanks!
When did you say the scavenger hunt is? Tonight?
thx
say it with meaninggggggggggggg
i miss you
Sure! How would this Wednesday at 6:30 work for you?
Sounds good
Nvm you're at res con
Were in the commons btw
Yeah yeah come thru!
Will-do. I'll also talk to him tonight in mountain view
Yes but I haven't heard back. Sharon told me all the way when I applied that it'd be fine
I have a scheduling conflict between Peer Advising and ResCon. You are both too, right? How can I go to both trainings?
...now I feel inadequate
Also, what is that chart for? Bench press?

Ack sorry, I left my phone behind when I went to the track, I just 
I want you here too :(
Sounds good:) love you 
Let me know how it goes
Nice. Good luck
I have family up at the house that I have to go see...
Prolly won't be here too much longer 
We just payed the check 
But probably not
Still at Applebee's drinking 
Res con training soon right?
Was going to invite you
I was having a party at my house
Totally forgot to answer this
Whoops
Lmfao
I'll keep you posted 
Sounds good homie 
Lol idk what's going on yet. I'm at Applebee's currently lol
     What's up??
 My hero, thank you!
Sincerely never got that email, I'm not sure what happened...where are we meeting and when?
When did that email about the informal meeting come in? I can't find it
Okey dokes, Hempstead 203
Not at all, come through! Will you be by soonish, or later? I might run first, depending
Yeah for sure I'll see you then
Haha yessir! What time works for you to come by? I'll be here tonight and most of tomorrow 
Nice, did they reduce it for you?
What are your plans for the evening
Erik
Mhmm okay. How did your ticket situation go?
I drove the highway, in proud of myself
Yes sir
Also, my car isn't registered yet...am I going to get ticketed?
They just rolled out, my Dads adamant about getting back before dark :/ my mom and grandma came too, it was the whole clan
But I was about to ask you the same thing, I just came down this afternoon. You here too?
I'm not coming back up anywhere
Haha well I hope you had a good time at least with your friends. That new gym sounds dope
How was The pose down?
That... sounds like it could be somewhat plausible. I can imagine Vaidy in his sneakers, walking into class with that shirt with a dog in sunglasses labeled "Cool Dog" or something like that. And I'd be hard pressed to believe Vaidy actually takes off the wax paper in real life. He seems like the ketchup-stained, cold-coffee drinking person who thinks "Who has time for that? There is just no time. There are just so many examples..."
Monahans in like 35 min
No we're leaving soon
Idk we're at the mall right now

sually had people come in and sign a plea affidavit
Pretty much. Say you have a clean record, you'll be out of town and won't be able to make the hearing, would it be possible to get this reduced? My Dad u
the guys not a jerk
It might not work, but my Dad was the prosecutor for in Eden for a few years and people called in to get parking tickets reduced all the time. Hopefully 
 to a parking ticket. Apparently that usually works, but since my Dad doesn't know what the people in Oneida are like he's not sure.
Hmm, well my Dad said you should call the clerk of the court, get the prosecutors name, and call the prosecutor and ask him/her if you can reduce if down
Look for the VTL, should be in the middle of the summons on the left-hand side
He said it would be 1200-something
I just caught up with my Dad, he was wondering what the ticket number is?
What did you do he says
Oh wow good luck to you, and let me ask him
I know, and we'll be packing. How are things going with you. And what legal advice, everything ok?
Alright I guess, my internship ends Sunday and I go to school the 20th the summer went too quick

itâs an image i somehow successfully avoided fully imagining while writing that text and it better stay that way
iâm a stripper cop does that count
I will gladly partake in this
Also, it definitely seemed at first glance that youâre looking to trade dope
(y)
I want you to do that this semester and Iâd like to watch
lololol i want 2 see this
^ that 100%
so
Yeah, I avoid r/circlejerk and HH circleterk like the plague
Ah, got it
What was it a reference to?
Yeah, sorry
what
Google in general is teh suck
Fair enough
I wasn't wrong...
Carrots are okay, but broccoli tastes better
Broccoli?
Rude
Give them a shot, theyâre both great, entertaining, and probably a bit more applicable to every-day life than Gordon Ramsey.
Yeah, going out to eat is always the problem - we do it too oftenâ¦ :(
Nice! You should subscribe to Food Wishes on YouTube, and Chef Tips, both great cooking videos chock full of bad puns and dad jokes. Theyâre great channels, and Iâve been watching them for years now. Itâs where Iâve learned most of my recipes. Food Wishes is the more professional channel, and Chef John (the guy who runs it) is fantastic.
I donât do it well enough, but I try to when I can
Eating healthy is generally not a terrible idea either
Hey, sounds like a good idea. Hummus + veggies is a great snack
Are you grocery shopping? :P
Basically, any cracker, and any dipping vegetable will do
Also, carrots and bell peppers
Potentially, multigrain pita chips (my favorite choice).
Sorry again, crazy work weekend :/ but that's awesome! Do I get to hear what your dope idea is?
Lol, no
I'm getting exactly what I paid for and what it says on the tin
lol I like the file name
ty ty :)
If youâre interested in this stuff in general, you should take Advanced OOP (Iâm taking it next semester, but take it when you fulfill the prereqs)
Sure, Iâll take it. :) Just curious about whatâs in there.
lol <3
Cool -- send me a link to that?
It would inherit the one from its parent, since that method overrides the one from the grandparent.
Out of curiosity, what brought this to your interest?
Most languages only have single-inheritance, to avoid this very problem. D would only be able to inherit from B _or_ C, but not both.
Thatâs what the diamond problem is, but in cases where there are no conflicts, yes, D will inherit all the methods from A, B, and C.
Yes. The issue is what if classes B and C have different methods that have the same name -- which one does D inherit?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem
I can make a class D which inherits from two classes B and C which both inherit from A.
C++ does, though.
Anyway, very few languages have the diamond inheritance pattern like in your second text.
No, your terminology is 100% correct for C++, but it doesnât apply for other languages.
In all OOP languages, the first thing is true (C inherits all methods from B, which inherits all methods from A).
Are you talking about C++ specifically, or in general?
Sure, what's up?
I have some time to talk now if you can.
She's not in my LinkedIn.  Damn
Yea
Yes
Yah
Yo why u no awake
And awh that's adorable, she seems pretty cool. Did you guys pick a project or something to work on when we get back to school?

Damn son, that's awesome. Proud of you. Keep it up. And keep up the healthy eating. PS. Love the way you worded that text lol
That's a keeper. His stats are pretty good. You have to wonder why he's was traded 3 times in like 2 years.
Don't worry. I've already made myself nauseous ð½.
I'm sick of being on thisð.
I never knew I had all of those options. I thought I just had the smiley face on my keypad.

Swag. We are obligated to get so trashed
Do you come back here before you go back to skool
Agggh. We are sad you are missing the beerlympics
Your internship ends the 14th right
Hey chief
It's out of character for them. Their young pitchers are dominant but their offense stinks. They are looking to trade for a bat. It's like watching the Devils or soccer.
Maybe
Ea
Y

Well I have a new skirt I wanted to wear for you both
Surely. Is it just me and you

sorry honey. i responded
haha thanks man
The reports came out that the trade was done on social media. Flores started crying at second base during the game. The Mets pulled out at the last minute because they were afraid of something on Gomez s medical report.
Aight. Now it's about finding a nigga to chill with during the day 
Word. 
Both
What about kosher food? 
What's the date again?
Let me ask ruth. Duh. 
Ohhhh. Fuck. 
Idk 
Jews? 
Which one
I have the money to do this. But I ain't tryna sit at the hotel by myself the entire day bro 
Doesn't wanna go...
I would do that. But I'm not trying to stay there the whole day by myself. 
Only a little,  What started it
Im gonna have to pass
Yo yo
Lol you said your friend has a place 
That's the only thing holding me back
Apartment. 
The only problem I'm concerned about is Shabbat. How I'm gonna do it at this kids house 
^Made my day
You say "Yeah" a lot
Now that I think about it, though, a lot of the fun people are gone ð
Patties are good too though
Parties*
I keep forgetting Brian Kim's still there! I can't wait for rescon patties
Lol, so much for CIW. I'm guessing they just assign them randomly then?
Twice as fast for text books and 3 times as fast for regular reading.
U got a letter from bing about speed reading classes.
Your boy jack just showed up at the library
Fine
In practice, probably not
In principle, yes
I don't have clubs
Tulo traded for Reyes plus prospects.
Heavy drinking will occur in your honor 
You will be missed 
Of course love 
Aww that sucks ð I'll see what I can do but I feel like it's not gonna be possible past that week because everyone starts to leave for school. I'm sorry sweetie pie, it's so hard to coordinate everyone. But don't worry ticket party is being saved for winter break I promise we would never do that without you
3 weeks actually 
Is there any time you would come home before them 
But Emily leaves in 2 weeks 
We're trying really hard to accommodate everyone 
And I said to do it on a weekend lol
And she asked me that since you can only come on a weekend if we should do it on a weekend
Idk were probably gonna do it at caros
It should be both. Ya know, to keep you on your toes
Hehehe I'm gonna add her and yell at her
She's cute
But yeah i found her
Why don't you have an iPhone damnit
My roommates little is a mutual friend with me
This her?
Both bitch
Hahahahahahahahah
Just as guys don't like girls who look desperate, girls don't like guys who seem too thirsty. We like what we can't have
Don't look too eager
Just be cool. DO NOT THINK TOO MUCH INTO IT. I swear to god you're a girl sometimes
And likes nice boys like me
Also maybe she's not into super douchey frat guys
Hahaha don't sell yourself too short kiddo
Meh...usually, yeah
I said you'd be the next Trump because of your wealth, not field
I'm already aware that you think I'm an idiot - if I really didn't know what real estate was I would have googled it instead of asking you
You're so mean to me
I was joking
What is real estate?
But yeah, see where it takes ya. If nothing else, just steal her design ideas and be the next Trump
Dat hair flip, doe
Well I wouldn't assume she gets a lot of attention, maybe she's quiet or doesn't go out as often as you think. Frat guys can suck, too.
Nice, I see she's biochem too, I respect that
She in our year?
Grrrr ð
Do you think she's actually being flirty or thinks you'll be a great addition to her app team
You're right, she is pretty and does seem like fun
Hmmmm but let's think about this Erik
If you don't want to tell me I understand though, I respect your privacy
True name, or gtfo
...ð
Lol
The sarcastic in me says "Of course not", but the genuine part of me says yes
What's her name? Can I FB stalk her?
re it takes you? Let me know how your conversation goes tonight
You don't sound very enthusiastic...I can't really speak for her since I have no clue what she's like, but that is kinda random. Keep talking and see whe
I see...now the main question, are you interested in her?
Oh. I just talked to Jinju. She says there can only be one Jinju hehehe
What happened
Hmm. Did you reply to her Saturday message?
What was the last thing you guys talked about before she said that to you?
ð¬ð¬ð¬
But I'll try my best. Shoot
I'm not a girl...
How is life?

Throwing daggers at the pills bury doughboy

How was that interaction? :P
Yeah, I remember, heâs also interning in Rome for something else entirelyâ¦
lolololololololooooooooooooolooooooooooooooloooooooooooool
Lol good please explain it to me because I don't think I ever really got it myself
Machine learning was a cluster last semester; we essentially took the Coursera course (parts of it, and parts of a different curriculum) online and got quizzed and tested on it, with some additional homework and projects. It was structured awfully, but thankfully, itâs a different professor this semester. (Lei Yu is fantastic.)

Why?
:) :) :) :)
*bowing* lol
Well, nice! Glad things are going well.

I miss having you in my life, Erik. :( Canât wait to get back to Bing!
Seems good! Going on my wish list. :)
Sweet. Sounds like a lot of hard work, tbh, but probably really rewarding when it works.
And cool, lemme look it up -- I might like reading it.
Awesome! Iâm glad! What are you working on now?

And, #swert, watcha readinâ? Programming stuff, or fun books?
lol thx
It has to do with object serialization for sending object between processes. Itâs a neat project, but I canât really say much about it. (Iâll tell you a bit more in personâ¦ :))

How are you doing? Howâs work in Rome? :)
But overall, Iâm happy with work, even if Iâve got a lot of it.
Rawr ...

Things are going pretty well! I've been really busy the last two weeks because I had to present my intern project to management yesterday. I've been busy working on that, but it seems to have paid off because they want me to present again to management higher up on Tuesday.
Howâs it going?
hiii Erik
I will come looking for you with Hatians
Hah I will have to check it out
Nothing really.I might be off that week.
When is your job over for the summer.?will u be down sometime around August 15?

Iâve been itching to play but my weird apartment-mate and friend have been sitting at the only table in the apartment for hours doing nothing, and I canât play. :(
Good! Just hanging out, wasting my weekends awayâ¦ :) I picked up a game called âDivinity: Original Sinâ so wasting a lot of time on that.

thy bodyfat percentage. On average I would say ~250 calories less then that rate would be ideal for you to burn fat, but still get enough food to build 
 once you determine that number, you can then make sure to eat slightly less, if you want to lose weight and fat faster, until you get yourself to a heal
You can use this website to figure out how many calories you need per day to maintain your weight based on your level of exercise

That actually reminds me to send you a link to a basal metabolic rate calculator
I've been using that website for years. It's amazing and the best resource. Glad you found it!

You can browse the meat section in the supermarket and just visually look at how marbled the various cuts of meat or and determine which ones are leaner 
I always got either shell steak, ribeye, or some other kind of relatively lean New York Strip without the bone
The leanest steak is London broil but I've never cared for it because it's too chewy for me
k, go for anything that's lean...
Honestly you don't need seasoning and you will grow to enjoy the taste of steak simply cooked on the grill with nothing else on it. When selecting a stea
Not really. The natural flavor of the steak was always enough for me. You might be able to find a salt free Mrs dash steak seasoning tho.

No problems.  I am not sure they would have left it unless there was a room number on it.  If so then it is in the mailbox.  I will check tomorrow and le
Not from Ups or FedEx.  If it's parcel post check your mail box.  I will keep an eye out.
Jeff DeLutis
Do you have a phone number or email for your bing landlord/management co?
Nice
want to check out the fort on friday?
Gotta love innapropriate molestation jokes
Lmfaoð that's a good one.
Despite how sexual that sounds Yep that's pretty much exactly how it went.
It was a nice confidence boost. Lmfao
I used to play all of the little kids in connect four when I volunteered for after school at my middle school. Of course I'd win.
Well you've got it and then some.
I like it.
A fool proof plan
That'd be so creepy
Lmao
If she responds you should just play her, beat her, and never message her again
Who doesn't wanna play connect four
LOL that's great
Yeah napping is included in my daily routine nowadays
Lol tinder really? Any potentials?
Hbu?
The usual
Nm. Working, living, thuggin
Yas you won't regret it.
Can't we just make this work somehow? Polyandry is becoming more and more popular these days
That's not gunna fly.
No.
Haha
Aha
I want a divorce.
Yeah well this lack of communication is taking a toll on our relationship Erik
Lol
You can just come out and say it instead of taking this roundabout way
I know you wanna see me Erik
Lmao no problemo
Also also, I'm listening to WBLK, and Yoga just came on. I spazzed, I almost forgot about that song
Also having trouble with the connect four board :/
And thank you! I wanna get ahead start on things
I don't think they have coding projects at my work...Ill see what I can do
Wow, that sounds incredible!
The Dallas cowboys are going to use virtual reality helmets for practices. It cuts down on hits . The company is STRIVR. 5 sec teams are also going to use them. They say every nfl team will be using them in 3 years.
What are you using Java for exactly? I'm jealous, I wish I was programming at work
Yeah, that's not too bad. First product name: "We Did a Thing"
So, I'm working on some code and it does a few things which help, but it's still kind of not done, right? Yeah, so that's the project. Hope that clarifies.
*cool.
Sounds good!

It kind of depends on where we decide to go with the project. Currently, it's really not glamorous at all (and isn't really user-facing), but potentially useful. If we decide to make it flashier, it could be really cools
Sounds good! Eventually it'll get easier. :)
How's Jack doing?

I'm doing pretty well -- I've got my intern project that I'm working on, and that's been good so far. Going to WWDC soon to go help out at some labs, so that's fun, too.
Howâs work going, BTW?
(Sorry.)
ha you said âdutyâ
Interesting. Duly noted.
Canât tell whoâs having more of a stroke currently, me or you woof
Itâs cool stuff. iOS 9 is way more baller, though. Really cool features in there.
Yep. Directly following the current Yosemite.

Tommy's driving us to Taco Bell now 
It's good!
Thank you homie
<3
I stand by my opinion that I miss you hooligans.
lool @ that whole text
Eh, this poop is alright. It's one of those where you feel like you really need to poop but not a lot comes out. My butthole also burns a little bit but that's okay because I'm going to take a shower right after.

... you're onto us. I'm sorry, Erik. I'm going to have to... eliminate you from the equation.
Good! WWDC is this week, so looking forward to that. The Keynote is tomorrow, so we'll hear about all the stuff Apple is releasing this year.

I'm doing well - I don't do much on the weekends; just lazing about. (Currently pooping.)
Hahahaha
Lololololol <3
Also, I love the profile.
Nice be right there
Cool
Want to leave like 130?
Yeah. I ate something earlier so if you'd be ok pushing it back a lil great, if not still yes
It was some kind of basket sale thing, doesn't really matter. The point was that I was able to look around a bit. It's suuper nice in there. And super organized too
So I just got back from infiltrating an RFA event 
I keep thinking about that Itai text so heartfelt 
Also tell me when you've got Chicago so I can add those in 
The tex mex? Yeah def

Yo want to get lunch
Nite!

Yeah, shit hours tho :/ I'm pretty jealous of your 9-5...first week went well?
NOOOOO
Banquet hall like 15-20 hours, internship 20 hours. It's alright
Self-control is limited at 1am
I work at a banquet hall and they make us take food home
 I just ate like 4 cupcakes...
Kinky
How many pins we talking?
It might not be
What exactly is your juggling record?
I like it! You come across as genuine and funny, well done
Do you sleep in barracks and stuff?
Good for you buddy

"I enjoy tickling people's anuses." usually goes over well.
Lolololol you're asking me?
Lmao good luck dude 
And that's awesome how's the virtual reality?
That sounds really cool! Were you given a project to work on?

Also, lol, how's Tinder treating you?
I'm doing well! :) How's Rome and the Air Force?

Meh, you have to remember it's Tinder. Adding a genuine "How's your night going?" or something along those lines helps. Just act legitimately interested
I hate you. "Hey"
DONT BE CREEPY. You're literally thinking so much into tinder
If you want
You can talk to her lol
This is tinder. Not match.com
I wanna see
Microsoft Verification Code: 9098
No
You're overthinking. Do what you're penis tells you
When you're a red head, you're either banging hot or fugly with no soul. No in between
If you see BeyoncÃ©, I will be the one banging her
What's wrong with black girls. BeyoncÃ©. Rihanna. Nicki Minaj.
So many losers on there, I've seen so many descriptions like "tits or gtfo", or "no ass? I'll pass." Avoiding things like that already puts you ahead
I can't wait
Get that pussy
Lmao, go with that that's perfect
Hahaha yeah that's good
you can make it more original than that, you're golden
Hmm...im horrible at those things, but just don't make it cliche. Everybody's description is like "I love animals, I'm outdoorsy, and I love sports." If 
Either a funny one liner. Or just like where you're from/school. Because the guys who put like a paragraph look like losers who are trying to hard

They have been showing Lizards games on msg. They are 7-0 and they are saying they could be the best team in the history of us lacrosse. They have the team usa goalie.
I'm really looking forward to it... Kinda surprised Jack is with the program, though; I guess college really loosened him up.
I mean, you definitely look like a kid in it, but maybe. :p
Looooooooooooooooooool that's hilarious.

I don't know who you're going to find in fucking Rome, NY, but good luck and Godspeed.

What I almost sent: "Sorry, I just got home from work and was all sticky so I had to shower"
I don't have any pictures on my phone. Just my computer, I'll check when I go home. But I think I put all of them on Facebook

The king in crushing defeats is one of the best things in sports. It could have been 4 or 5 to 0 without him, but he did let in a softie. He's still a king without a crown. I was kind of hoping Callahan would score the game winner but il take the king giving up a softie.
I will give you a key on monday. Slide under your door

Happy Ranger elimination day. Hawks are on at 8 tonight.

That's good. I guess you got there before 4.  The Brazilians made it home ok.  When we said goodbye at the gate Hosangela had tears and an expression that was indescribable. It was very moving.
   How did everything go today?
Dude, no worries. Nice! Sounds like a good time. I hope you have a nice apartment and stuff. :)
I am guessing you're you are in Rome or nearby. It was so nice to see you.  You always make my day.  :-)  Enjoy the internship. Keep in touch. 
If you're serious there's something wrong with you
Sounds good! You start working on Monday, yeah?
Ah gotcha
So are you in Rome now, or still on your way?
